"['London:Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, wanted in India on fraud and money laundering charges amounting to $2 billion, spent Holi behind bars in one of England\'s most overcrowded jails on Thursday, a day after a UK judge rejected his bail application.The 48-year-old was arrested by Scotland Yard on Tuesday and presented before District Judge Marie Mallon at Westminster Magistrates\' Court in London on Wednesday.The judge remanded him in custody till March 29 after which he was transferred to Her Majesty\'s Prison (HMP) Wandsworth in south-west London.While he would hope to be held in a separate cell, the overcrowding pressures of the jail may mean him sharing a prison cell with any of its around 1,430 male prisoners.Nirav Modi, one of India\'s richest men accustomed to the high-life and celebrity circles around the world, will be faced with some harsh conditions at the prison amid some dubious inmates.During the most recent inspection carried out in February-March 2018, the Victorian-era jail was found by UK Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke to be ""one of the most overcrowded in England and Wales"" and filled with many men with drug or mental health problems, receiving poor training and education.""Despite six self-inflicted deaths since the last inspection, it was concerning to find that not all staff were carrying anti-ligature knives, that no staff would enter a cell alone - even if a prisoner\'s life was in danger - and that the response to cell call bells was totally inadequate,"" he noted.Prison cells designed for one prisoner are often occupied by two, with poorly-screened lavatories and inmates being allowed ""far too little"" time out of their cells, his inspection had concluded.The living conditions will certainly be in stark contrast to the luxury apartment at Centre Point in the West End of London where Nirav Modi has been living over the past year, as it was confirmed during court proceedings on Wednesday.""He has done everything he possibly can to be visible, to demonstrate his keenness to fully cooperate [with UK authorities],"" George Hepburne Scott, Nirav Modi\'s Barrister, told the court in support of his bail application.Among the details that emerged during the hearing, it was claimed that Nirav Modi was in the UK ""lawfully"", having acquired a National Insurance No. - offered only to legal residents to be able to live and work in the UK.He had reportedly also been paying his Council Tax, which is a local tax paid by a UK resident to the local authority and also serves as an identity document for address proof. Based on this, he also received an offer from the UK electoral register to register to vote and had submitted one of three passports to the UK\'s Driving and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) to apply for a driver\'s licence.However, Nirav Modi\'s defence team\'s efforts to establish his credibility as a lawful UK resident who had no intention of jumping bail and fleeing were strongly objected to by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities.The judge in the end ruled in favour of the Indian authorities, concluding that the wanted diamantaire had ""substantial grounds"" to fail to surrender, and remanded him in custody until his next hearing, scheduled for March 29.9 COMMENTSThe court was told that Nirav Modi is wanted by the Indian authorities for his role as a partner in a number of entities, namely Diamonds R Us, Stellar Diamonds and Solar Exports, involved in the laundering of money and the fraudulent issuing of Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) to Punjab National Bank (PNB).Get the latest election news, live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

"['New Delhi:Prime Minister Narendra Modi will contest from his sitting constituency Varanasi in the Lok Sabha elections that begin next month, the BJP announced today, as it launched its first list of candidates for the national elections. Unlike the last elections, PM Modi will not be contesting from a second seat this time.In 2014, PM Modi contested from Varanasi as well as Vadodara in his home state Gujarat. After winning both, he decided to retain the holy city in Uttar Pradesh.In Varanasi, he won with a huge margin over his rivals Arvind Kejriwal and Congress\'s Ajay Rai.The BJP\'s assessment is that having PM Modi as a candidate shored up its tally in Uttar Pradesh, where it won a staggering 71 of 80 seats in 2014.There had been speculation that the prime minister may opt for another temple town of Puri, but top party sources had dismissed the rumours and said he is likely to stick with Varanasi.Uttar Pradesh is one of the most crucial states of the Hindi heartland. With the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party alliance in the state and the Congress fielding their trump card Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as a general secretary, the state\'s elections will be one to watch out for. The opposition Congress has already captured the other major states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in the last concluded assembly elections.5 COMMENTSVaranasi will vote on May 19, in the last round of seven-phase polls that start on April 11.

He has since been living in London ""lawfully"" and his son has been studying at school in the city for five years.It was claimed he arrived in the UK for an initial public offering (IPO) of his business and plans for his brand headquarters to be based in London. He has since been based in London while being employed by Diamond Holdings for 20,000 pounds a month and also pursuing educational courses.""The allegations in India arose in an unusual way...leading him to engage lawyers in the UK, who have been in contact with the extradition squad of Scotland Yard since February 2018,"" Mr Scott said, adding that his legal team has since repeatedly informed the UK authorities that he is ""keen to fully cooperate"" in any extradition matters.It was claimed that the tacit arrangements being struck between Boutique Law and Scotland Yard were thrown awry due to the ""widespread publicity"" of the case worldwide and Nirav Modi was arrested as he tried to open a bank account in London.""He is in possession of a wealth of material in support of his case... and intends to make comprehensive arguments against the allegations, including that of political motivation and human rights,"" Mr Scott noted.

He was picked up on Wednesday from a metro station Holborn, central London, said officers in the Enforcement Directorate, which is probing the case against him.Produced within hours at the Metropolitan Magistrate\'s court, he had offered half-a-million pounds as bail bond, but the court turned it down. He will be in jail till March 29, when the next hearing will take place.Judge Marie Mallon said she was remanding Nirav Modi to custody ""given the high value of amount involved in the allegations, and the access you may have to means of escape.... I have substantial grounds to believe that you may fail to surrender"".A week ago, UK issued a warrant against him following India\'s request for his extradition. But a decision on the extradition cannot be taken without a long-drawn legal process, as is happening in the case of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who fled to UK in 2017 as banks tried to recover loans to the tune of Rs 9000 crore from him.UK has recently approved Vijay Mallya\'s extradition, but the matter is now pending with its Home Office.The External Affairs Ministry said they welcome Nirav Modi\'s arrest. ""Government of India continues to actively follow up this matter with the authorities concerned in the UK, with a view to have Nirav Modi extradited to India at the earliest,"" the External Affairs Ministry said.Nirav Modi is believed to be living at a 33-storey Centre Point Apartment complex in West End, the post theatre district in London. Last month, he was sighted in London, walking around in an expensive ostrich-hide jacket. He had brushed off the questions of a reporter who spotted him, with a ""no comments"". The Telegraph, where the reporter worked, later reported that he has started a diamond business in Soho after acquiring necessary permits.The 48-year-old billionaire had skipped the country last year, weeks before the detection of the Rs 13,000-crore Punjab National Bank scam. His relative Mehul Choksi, who was also wanted in the case, has been granted citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda.The Central Bureau of Investigation is probing the scam, which involved fake guarantees in the name of the state-run lender to secure loans overseas.The arrest is expected to come as a shot in the arm for the BJP, which is under Congress attack in the matter. The Congress has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of aiding industrialists like Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.Minutes after the arrest, Union Minister Hardeep Puri tweeted:You can run, but cannot hide from the country\'s #Chowkidar.

"['Patna:Bihar was conspicuously missing when the BJP announced its first list of candidates for next month\'s national election on Thursday, after days of deliberation. The ruling party said its 17 candidates in Bihar would be announced by its state leadership, along with alliance partners.The move has raised curiosity, given that the names of BJP\'s candidates in Bihar are more or less public.Party leaders reveal that there\'s a worry about ""over representation of upper castes"" in a state where caste is a pivotal theme in poll math.Sources say the BJP wants to wait until its ally, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar\'s Janata Dal United, finalises its candidates.According to a list that has been floating in the public domain, but has neither been confirmed nor denied, nine of the 17 candidates - the BJP\'s share of the state\'s 40 seats following its deal with allies - are from the upper castes which constitute 15 per cent of Bihar\'s population.Among these nine candidates is Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who is set to fight against his party colleague-turned-rebel Shatrughan Sinha in the Patna Saheb constituency. Ravi Shankar Prasad is from the Kayastha community.The other candidates, Radha Mohan Singh, Rajkumar Singh, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Sushil Singh and Janardan Singh Sigriwal, are all from Rajput caste. Union Minister Giriraj Singh, who is expected to move to the Begusarai seat, is from the Bhumihar caste and there are two Brahmins - Ashwini Choubey And Gopalji Thakur.More than 15 percent BJP candidates, therefore, are from the upper caste. In the remaining eight seats, two candidates are from the Economically Backward Class and five from the OBC (Other Backward Class). One candidate, Chedi Paswan, is from the Scheduled Caste and will contest from the Sasaram seat, which is reserved.The BJP has apparently learnt its lesson from the 2015 assembly elections when its list was similarly ""over-represented by upper castes"". The party lost the election, winning only 53 of the state\'s 243 seats.The BJP leadership is hoping that it can get the caste algorithm right with the Janata Dal (United) list, which, it believes, will have more candidates from the backward castes.The party has still not forgotten when Nitish Kumar, then its rival, and Lalu Yadav had released their entire list for the 2015 election, putting the BJP-led coalition on the back-foot because their candidates were mostly from the backward caste.

It led to untimely death of people in road accidents and increase in alcohol intake among the youth,"" said the Minister while tabling the Bill.Legislator from the Zoram People\'s Movement (ZPM), Vanlalthlana, referred to the recent liquor ban in Bihar and said the move had led to reduction in crime in that state. ""While crime against women was reduced to 13 per cent after the liquor ban in Bihar, incidents of rape declined too,"" Mr Vanlalthlana said while supporting the Bill.In the last year\'s Mizoram Assembly polls, while the MNF promised a total ban, the Congress opposed it.

However, Tom Vadakkan -- who recently crossed over from the Congress to the BJP-- did not figure on the list.Pathanamthitta, a Lok Sabha seat in high demand among several state party candidates, was left out of the list released by Union Minister JP Nadda. This constituency houses the Sabarimala temple, which witnessed intense protests last year against a Supreme Court order allowing women below 50 years to enter in violation of an age-old religious stricture. It is believed that the protests may have helped the BJP build a groundswell ofsupport in Pathanamthitta, a reason why several leaders -- including state president Sreedharan Pillai -- are keen on it.The BJP fielded Union Tourism Minister KJ Alphons from Ernakulam against two-time Congress legislator Hibi Eden. Ernakulam is a Congress stronghold that 72-year-old party legislator KV Thomas has won five times in the past. Disappointed at not being given a ticket for the elections, Mr Thomas hit out at his party before eventually falling in line and extending his support to Mr Eden.Taking on two-time parliamentarian Shashi Tharoor will be former Mizoram Governor Kummanam Rajasekharan, a leader who rose through the RSS ranks to become the BJP state president between 2015-18. The BJP and Congress have locked horns ahead of the polls in this constituency, with both accusing the other of seeking votes on religious grounds before the state electoral officer.The Left has fielded three-time legislator C Divakaran who has a past record of winning from seats , where he is least expected to win.Incidentally, Mr Vadakkan had quit the Congress for the BJP after reportedly being denied electoral tickets on many occasions. However, he did not figure in the list announced by the BJP either. The veteran leader had quit the Congress for the opposition party on March 14, saying that it was out of disappointment over its response to the recent Indian Air Force attacks in Pakistan\'s Balakot.3 COMMENTSThe BJP is contesting 14 of the 20 Lok Sabha constituencies in Kerala.

"['Lok Sabha Election 2019: The deadline to file the nominations is March 25.New Delhi:The ruling BJP\'s first list of candidates for the Lok Sabha elections were announced today. A list of 182 names were announced today.According to sources, the BJP has finalised 27 of the 42 seats in the state. The deadline to file the nominations is March 25, which means if the party announces the candidates\' list after Holi festival, the candidates will have just a day to file their papers.A week after the Trinamool Congress announced its candidates for all 42 seats in West Bengal, the candidates have hit the ground to campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.The decision on tickets for Babul Supriyo from Asansol, former TMC members Soumitra Khan and Anupam Hazara as well as the candidature of SS Ahluwalia from Darjeeling will be taken by the BJP leadership soon.Here are the Live Updates from Lok Sabha Election campaigning:Mar 21, 201921:50 (IST)-->From Biju Janata Dal To BJP, Jay Panda\'s Lok Sabha Seat Remains ConstantOdisha leader Baijayant Jay Panda who joined the BJP early this month and was subsequently appointed the state\'s national vice-president and spokesperson will be contesting the Lok Sabha elections from his last sitting seat Kendrapara. He vacated his seat and resigned from Odisha\'s ruling Biju Janata Dal last year. Mr Panda\'s name was announced in the BJP\'s first list of 184 candidates released today.Mr Panda is a four-time parliamentarian and had retained his Kendrapara seat since 2009 till he quit. In the last two elections, he contested from a BJD ticket. Whether he can pull off a win on a BJP ticket is something to look out for, in the state Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has had in an iron grip since 2000. Kendrapara, too, has been a BJD seat since 1998.Jay Panda, 55, quit the BJD last May after a bitter fall out with his party chief Naveen Patnaik. Since then, he had been seen to gravitate towards the BJP, which has been trying to make in-roads in Odisha.Jay Panda\'s recently appointed vice-president position is a major responsibility which signals the importance the party has given him as it looks to improve its tally in the state. The seat is crucial as the BJP has only one seat in the state represented by Jual Oram in the Sundargarh seat.The owner of a large conglomerate with interests in mining, power and real estate, Jay Panda had been a parliamentarian of the BJD since 2000 and had been among the party\'s most prominent leaders from Odisha. Jay Panda said he had taken the step after nine months of introspection and widespread consultations with colleagues and the public.Assembly polls in the state will be held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha elections in four phases on April 11, 18, 23 and 29.The BJP had won only one of its 21 Lok Sabha seats in 2014 but is hopeful of putting up a much better show there after it emerged as the main challenger to the BJD in the local polls.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/2019-lok-sabha-election-campaign-live-updates-bjp-finalises-candidates-for-27-seats-in-bengal-2010688?q_id=13"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Mar 21, 201921:49 (IST)-->In UP\'s Amethi, Smriti Irani To Take On Rahul Gandhi For A Second TimeThe BJP on Monday released its first list of candidates for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, naming Smriti Irani as the party\'s candidate from Uttar Pradesh\'s Amethi. A Congress bastion for decades, the listing squarely sets Smriti Irani up for a second fight with party chief Rahul Gandhi.In the 2014 elections, she contested against Mr Gandhi and though she lost by more than one lakh votes, she managed to reduce Rahul Gandhi\'s winning margin.Since then, she has visited the constituency several times, accusing the Congress chief of treating the constituency as a vote bank and not investing in its progress.Besides Ms Irani, the BJP also named 27 other candidates from Uttar Pradesh in the list of 184 contenders for the Lok Sabha elections, now less than three weeks away.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi will contest from his current seat of Varanasi, BJP chief Amit Shah will replace party veteran LK Advani in Gujarat\'s Gandhinagar.Voting for the Lok Sabha elections will begin on April 11 and continue for over a month till May 19 across seven phases, followed by results on May 23.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/2019-lok-sabha-election-campaign-live-updates-bjp-finalises-candidates-for-27-seats-in-bengal-2010688?q_id=12"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Mar 21, 201921:48 (IST)-->PM Modi Picks Varanasi Again For Lok Sabha ElectionsPrime Minister Narendra Modi will contest from his sitting constituency Varanasi in the Lok Sabha elections that begin next month, the BJP announced today, as it launched its first list of candidates for the national elections. Unlike the last elections, PM Modi will not be contesting from a second seat this time.In 2014, PM Modi contested from Varanasi as well as Vadodara in his home state Gujarat. After winning both, he decided to retain the holy city in Uttar Pradesh.In Varanasi, he won with a huge margin over his rivals Arvind Kejriwal and Congress\'s Ajay Rai.The BJP\'s assessment is that having PM Modi as a candidate shored up its tally in Uttar Pradesh, where it won a staggering 71 of 80 seats in 2014.There had been speculation that the prime minister may opt for another temple town of Puri, but top party sources had dismissed the rumours and said he is likely to stick with Varanasi.Uttar Pradesh is one of the most crucial states of the Hindi heartland. With the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party alliance in the state and the Congress fielding their trump card Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as a general secretary, the state\'s elections will be one to watch out for. The opposition Congress has already captured the other major states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in the last concluded assembly elections.Varanasi will vote on May 19, in the last round of seven-phase polls that start on April 11. The results will be declared on May 23.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/2019-lok-sabha-election-campaign-live-updates-bjp-finalises-candidates-for-27-seats-in-bengal-2010688?q_id=11"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Mar 21, 201921:46 (IST)-->BJP Chief Amit Shah Replaces LK Advani As Gandhinagar Candidate For PollsBJP president Amit Shah will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare JP Nadda announced in a press meet called to release the party\'s first list on Thursday evening.The party fielded LK Advani from Gandhinagar in the 2014 elections. The veteran leader had defeated his closest rival from the Congress by over four lakh votes back then. Mr Advani\'s name did not figure in this list.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will contest from Varanasi, the same constituency he had won in the 2014 polls. The announcement put to rest speculations about him deciding to stand from Puri, another temple town in Odisha. While Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh will fight the elections from Lucknow, the party has decided to field Roadways Minister Nitin Gadkari from Nagpur, the headquarters of the RSS. The BJP has once again decided to pit Union Minister Smriti Irani against Congress president Rahul Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh\'s Amethi.

"['LUCKNOW:HighlightsUP has 19 per cent Muslim population, higher than national average \nCongress as solo player in polls wont affect Yadav vote, 2014 data shows\n79 per cent of Scheduled Caste votes for BSP and Samajwadi Partywindow._pricee = window._pricee || []; _pricee.push({container : \'_pcwgtmid\'});The key factors of caste and religion are likely to have a multiplier effect in Uttar Pradesh, with a divided opposition ranged against the ruling BJP, indicates data from last elections. It is very likely that a split in these votes may play into the hands of the BJP.The opposition parties - Mayawati\'s Bahujan Samaj Party, Akhilesh Yadav\'s Samajwadi Party and the Congress - have brushed off any such possibility. But math based on last election\'s figures indicate otherwise.Census data from 2011 shows Uttar Pradesh has 19 per cent Muslim population -- way higher than the national average of 14 per cent. The percentage of Scheduled Castes -- 21 per cent -- also stands higher than the national average of 17 per cent.But in a state like Uttar Pradesh, which has the highest population in India, these figures translate into a huge number of voters.Data from the 2014 election and exit polls show that Congress as a solo player in the electoral arena would not affect the Yadav vote, 80 per cent of which goes to Mayawati\'s Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party of Akhilesh Yadav.This is because the Congress gets only four per cent of the Yadav vote, way lower than the 16 per cent that the BJP draws.Of the Scheduled Caste votes, a mammoth 79 per cent, is scooped up by the SP and the BSP. Here too, the Congress lags behind with 3 per cent votes while the BJP gets a much larger 17 per cent chunk.Leaders of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav\'s parties say they are certain the Congress will not have any impact on their voter base. they are also positive that the Congress will eat into the BJP\'s upper caste vote bank -- an assumption that appears very off track in view of 2014 data.Numbers indicate that while the BJP gets 67 per cent of the state\'s Brahmin vote, the Congress claims only 12 per cent of the upper caste votes, way below the SP-BSP\'s 21 per cent.When it comes to Muslim votes, there is an 80-20 division between the SP-BSP and the Congress. And it is this category that might favour the Congress when the party competes separately.29 COMMENTSVoters from some villages said there was a good chance that more Muslims would vote for the Congress -- an outcome that would favour the BJP on a section of seats.Get the latest election news, live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.
