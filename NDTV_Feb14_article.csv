The other two cities occupying prominent positions on the list are Kanpur and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s constituency of Varanasi, both in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh.The study, which comes as a wake-up call for India, also revealed that the country witnessed 50% more pollution than China this year. It is based on data studied over a 45-day period through October and November last year. Although environmental issues are currently not grabbing headlines, environmentalists believe that greater conversation could even turn it into an election issue.The study showed that Patna, Kanpur and Varanasi suffered from poor or severe air quality over 31 days between October and November, with particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels hitting 170 micrograms per cubic metre and above. PM 2.5 particles reduce visibility and cause serious health issues in the general populace, an issue that the government has been unsuccessfully trying to address for several years now.Lawmakers blamed the phenomenon on the winter. ""We have got the stats, and are worried about Patna. We have made an action plan for the capital city, and are trying to implement it. Brick kilns that do not conform to our norms have been banned. We have asked builders to cover structures under construction to ensure that the air is not further polluted, and asked for roads to be cleaned regularly,"" said Bihar Environment Minister Sushil Modi.Mr Modi also cited the location of the Ganga near the Bihar capital as a reason for the city failing to achieve the required environmental standards. ""Cities situated along rivers are usually the most polluted. There is a big mound near Patna, and when wind blows, the air brings in a lot of dust. This happens primarily in the winter,"" he said.The study places Delhi at number 4 on the list of most polluted cities.Dr S Tripathi of IIT Kanpur said China seemed to be doing much better than India as far as curbing pollution was concerned. ""There are several sources of pollution in India, such as household fumes, solid fuel burning, power plant emissions and trash burning, which have turned out to be major contributors. We need to do something about this. It is a matter of great concern,"" he said.International climate experts also echo similar concerns. ""India should see the connection between pollution, climate change and health. Pollution is a particularly big problem in its cities. Secondly, they need to look at the long-term development pathway, and figure out how India can be turned into a zero carbon emitter in the future,"" said European Climate Foundation chief Executive officer Laurence Tubiana.7 COMMENTSMs Tubiana also said that India can no longer afford to treat pollution and climate action as secondary topics in the prevailing political discourse.

It does not include the controversial and key point of pricing, as the Defence Ministry maintained that these details could not be revealed. The parts in the report referring to cost are redacted, which may provoke fresh opposition attacks.The Congress and other opposition parties have dismissed the report as biased because auditor Rajiv Mehrishi was Finance Secretary when the deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets was inked in 2016. The Congress alleges that Mr Mehrishi was ""complicit in the irregularities"" in the Rafale deal and alleged that ""the bungling was happening at the highest level with his direct or indirect complicity and consent"".The cost of the basic aircraft is the same in both cases.But the CAG report says compared to the 126-aircraft deal negotiated by the Congress-led government, India managed to save 17.08 per cent money for the India Specific Enhancements in the new contract. India had wanted 13 specific changes to the Rafale jet to make it more suited to the country\'s defence parameters. The CAG report suggests that the cost of these upgrades is far cheaper now.Aspects of the deal that are more expensive include engineering support package and performance-based logistics.""The lies of the Mahajhootbandhan stand exposed by the CAG report,"" tweeted union minister Arun Jaitley. ""It cannot be that the Supreme Court is wrong, the CAG is wrong and only the dynast is right,"" he added, taking a swipe at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who has been pummeling the government with allegations of corruption in the deal to benefit industrialist Anil Ambani.According to the CAG report, a Defence Ministry team in March 2015 recommended the scrapping of the previous 126-jet Rafale deal saying that Dassault Aviation was not the lowest bidder and the other player, European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, was not fully compliant with the tender requirements.The auditor also noted that the Indian Air Force did not define the Air Staff Qualitative Requirements or ASQRs properly, so none of the vendors could fully meet the parameters.The CAG report details have emerged as a report in The Hindu newspaper on Wednesday said at least three senior Defence Ministry officials among the seven-member Indian Negotiating Team were of the view that the final price offered by the French Government cannot be considered as \'better terms\' compared to the deal under the UPA.191 COMMENTSDisclaimer: NDTV has been sued for 10,000 crores by Anil Ambani\'s Reliance Group for its coverage of the Rafale deal']"

""If they had been so serious, they could have announced them in the last Budget itself. Now, announcement of these programmes is only meant for elections. It shows it is their election manifesto and not the Budget,"" the party\'s M Thambidurai had said.The BJP, looking to gain ground in the 39-seat state, has for over a year been pursuing the AIADMK, which is seen to be greatly weakened and riven by feuding after the death of its charismatic chief J Jayalalithaa in 2016. Its rival DMK has already announced that it will partner with the Congress.A series of income tax and CBI raids on the state Health Minister, Chief Secretary and the police chief meant that the AIADMK virtually surrendered itself to the BJP.In the past few months, the AIADMK was seen to be changing its stand on any alliance with the BJP, with Mr Thambidurai saying, ""The BJP had not done anything for Tamil Nadu. We will align only with a party that is good for the state"".In the 2014 national election, the AIADMK won 37 seats in the state. The BJP, snubbed by Jayalalithaa, formed an alliance with parties like MDMK, PMK and DMDK but ended up with just two seats.This time, the AIADMK is split in two, with a rebel faction supporting Jayalalithaa\'s long-time aide VK Sasikala, who made a failed bid to take over the party and chief ministership after her death, before being jailed for corruption. Sasikala\'s nephew TTV Dhinakaran has launched AMMK and even won Jayalalithaa\'s RK Nagar constituency in a by-election.But then again, last week, the AIADMK hinted that a tie-up with the BJP was definitely brewing.

The other two cities occupying prominent positions on the list are Kanpur and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s constituency of Varanasi, both in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh.The study, which comes as a wake-up call for India, also revealed that the country witnessed 50% more pollution than China this year. It is based on data studied over a 45-day period through October and November last year. Although environmental issues are currently not grabbing headlines, environmentalists believe that greater conversation could even turn it into an election issue.The study showed that Patna, Kanpur and Varanasi suffered from poor or severe air quality over 31 days between October and November, with particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels hitting 170 micrograms per cubic metre and above. PM 2.5 particles reduce visibility and cause serious health issues in the general populace, an issue that the government has been unsuccessfully trying to address for several years now.Lawmakers blamed the phenomenon on the winter. ""We have got the stats, and are worried about Patna. We have made an action plan for the capital city, and are trying to implement it. Brick kilns that do not conform to our norms have been banned. We have asked builders to cover structures under construction to ensure that the air is not further polluted, and asked for roads to be cleaned regularly,"" said Bihar Environment Minister Sushil Modi.Mr Modi also cited the location of the Ganga near the Bihar capital as a reason for the city failing to achieve the required environmental standards. ""Cities situated along rivers are usually the most polluted. There is a big mound near Patna, and when wind blows, the air brings in a lot of dust. This happens primarily in the winter,"" he said.The study places Delhi at number 4 on the list of most polluted cities.Dr S Tripathi of IIT Kanpur said China seemed to be doing much better than India as far as curbing pollution was concerned. ""There are several sources of pollution in India, such as household fumes, solid fuel burning, power plant emissions and trash burning, which have turned out to be major contributors. We need to do something about this. It is a matter of great concern,"" he said.International climate experts also echo similar concerns.

Party leaders told NDTV that they are in touch with the Samajwadi Party leadership and Priyanka Gandhi is likely to take forward the proposal for more seats directly with Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav.Akhilesh Yadav is open to negotiations, Samajwadi leaders told NDTV, but the challenge, they said, is convincing Mayawati. On record though, the parties are unwilling to comment on any possibility of renegotiations. ""This is something I cannot comment on,"" Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh Pramod Tiwari told NDTV.Priyanka Gandhi had handled the alliance negotiations with Akhilesh Yadav ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, but the results had been disastrous for both parties. Even so, while the Yadav junior had not ruled out future alliances, seat sharing talks for the last round of assembly elections in the heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh had proved a deal breaker.Akhilesh Yadav and more so Mayawati, were upset at the unyielding stance of local leaders of the Congress and cut the party out of the alliance in Uttar Pradesh, even if their lawmakers are supporting the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The Congress, since, announced that they will contest all 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, crucial for any party that hopes to rule at the Centre. As part of his commitment, Rahul Gandhi has dispatched his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and close aide Jyotioraditya Scindia to spearhead the party\'s poll preparations in the state.While Mayawati\'s Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi party had agreed to contest 38 seats each in Uttar Pradesh, Congress leaders now say they hope to convince Akhilesh Yadav to give them at least 8-10 seats.SP leaders, however, rule this out. ""If we are left with just 28 seats, it doesn\'t work out for us. It has to be adjusted between both parties,\'\' they said. There was, however, a disclaimer: ""But Akhilesh ji wants the best situation to defeat the BJP.\'\'An official spokesperson for the former UP Chief Minister said that such reports were ""speculative"".The window the Congress sees is because while the seats have been formalised between the BSP and the SP, they haven\'t announced them publicly just yet.Aparna Yadav, the sister-in-law of Akhilesh Yadav, has told NDTV that Priyanka Gandhi was an asset and if she was made the alliance\'s Chief Ministerial face in 2017, the elections could have gone very differently.The Congress\' internal calculations indicate that besides the Gandhi family strongholds of Amethi and Raebareli, they have a good chance in seats like Unnao, Kanpur, Barabanki, Pratapgarh and some seats in western UP.Congress strategists have emphasised that they are positioning the party to get upper caste votes. One of the key groups that are upset with the government is the Brahmins and party strategists indicate that they hope to cash in on it. The selective approach will also avoid any kind of conflict that they may have with the SP-BSP vote.21 COMMENTS']"

At the national level, we will all fight together,"" Ms Banerjee said, adding, ""For greater interest of the nation, I am ready to sacrifice my life, I am ready to sacrifice my party, I am ready to sacrifice everything.""The Trinamool leader\'s latest formula for opposition unity was announced at the \'Save the Constitution\' platform in New Delhi\'s Jantar Mantar and came hours after Congress president Rahul Gandhi walked up to Trinamool lawmakers on dharna on the grounds of parliament this morning against the BJP government.Till today, the Trinamool and the Congress had kept a reciprocal distance from each other, turning the mahagathbandhan into an anti-BJP as well as non-Congress front.But today saw many firsts.CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury and CPI\'s D Raja shared the stage with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal at Jantar Mantar. They left before Ms Banerjee was expected onstage at 3 pm. But they have never come so close to sharing a stage ever before.The other first was Trinamool lawmakers protesting outside parliament and adopting Rahul Gandhi\'s slogan against Prime Minister Modi: ""Chowkidar chor hai"". It was only on Saturday that Mamata Banerjee had given cognizance to the Congress fight against PM Modi on the Rafale issue.Chalking out a draft plan for the battle ahead, Ms Banerjee reiterated the need to field one opposition candidate against the BJP candidate. ""Fight where you are strong,"" she said. ""Nothing will happen to me. We are used to fighting Congress, BJP, CPM. They all fight together. Even if we have an understanding, they will not do a vote transfer, that is their habit. However had they fight, I will get 42 on 42 seats."" Ms Banerjee\'s claim may sound tall but she is a formidable political fighter. Her Trinamool Congress ended the 34-year rule of the Left Front in Bengal. The Trinamool has reduced Ms Banerjee\'s parent party, the Congress into a ""signboard"" in Bengal. There is no love lost between the two sides and, this morning, in parliament, senior Congress lawmaker from Bengal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, launched a scathing attack on the Trinamool over the Saradha Ponzi scheme. Alleged links with the Ponzi scams has led to the arrest of several Trinamool leaders who are now out on bail. The CBI investigation into the matter had triggered her latest flashpoint with the centre.Mr Chowdhury\'s remarks were at the bottom of her heated exchange with the former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in Parliament today. Ms Banerjee is known to share a good equation with the UPA chairperson. But today, when they met at parliament\'s Central Hall, the upset Chief Minister said, ""We will remember"". ""We are accusing each other but we are friends,"" Sonia Gandhi had said.Ms Banerjee\'s announcement is part of the opposition\'s efforts to put behind their differences and come together for a common cause.Last year, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, the self-appointed interlocutor of the opposition, had turned his back to three decades of political rivalry and reached out to the Congress. In various media interviews, Mr Naidu has admitted that it was a political compulsion. 50 COMMENTSThough there has been no big announcement, the Congress and Mr Kejriwal\'s Aam Aadmi Party, whose differences are well known, are also trying to work together.']"

Its rival DMK has already announced that it will partner with the Congress.A series of income tax and CBI raids on the state Health Minister, Chief Secretary and the police chief meant that the AIADMK virtually surrendered itself to the BJP.In the past few months, the AIADMK was seen to be changing its stand on any alliance with the BJP, with Mr Thambidurai saying, ""The BJP had not done anything for Tamil Nadu. We will align only with a party that is good for the state"".In the 2014 national election, the AIADMK won 37 seats in the state.

Party leaders told NDTV that they are in touch with the Samajwadi Party leadership and Priyanka Gandhi is likely to take forward the proposal for more seats directly with Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav.Akhilesh Yadav is open to negotiations, Samajwadi leaders told NDTV, but the challenge, they said, is convincing Mayawati. On record though, the parties are unwilling to comment on any possibility of renegotiations. ""This is something I cannot comment on,"" Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh Pramod Tiwari told NDTV.Priyanka Gandhi had handled the alliance negotiations with Akhilesh Yadav ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, but the results had been disastrous for both parties. Even so, while the Yadav junior had not ruled out future alliances, seat sharing talks for the last round of assembly elections in the heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh had proved a deal breaker.Akhilesh Yadav and more so Mayawati, were upset at the unyielding stance of local leaders of the Congress and cut the party out of the alliance in Uttar Pradesh, even if their lawmakers are supporting the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The Congress, since, announced that they will contest all 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, crucial for any party that hopes to rule at the Centre. As part of his commitment, Rahul Gandhi has dispatched his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and close aide Jyotioraditya Scindia to spearhead the party\'s poll preparations in the state.While Mayawati\'s Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi party had agreed to contest 38 seats each in Uttar Pradesh, Congress leaders now say they hope to convince Akhilesh Yadav to give them at least 8-10 seats.SP leaders, however, rule this out. ""If we are left with just 28 seats, it doesn\'t work out for us. It has to be adjusted between both parties,\'\' they said. There was, however, a disclaimer: ""But Akhilesh ji wants the best situation to defeat the BJP.\'\'An official spokesperson for the former UP Chief Minister said that such reports were ""speculative"".The window the Congress sees is because while the seats have been formalised between the BSP and the SP, they haven\'t announced them publicly just yet.Aparna Yadav, the sister-in-law of Akhilesh Yadav, has told NDTV that Priyanka Gandhi was an asset and if she was made the alliance\'s Chief Ministerial face in 2017, the elections could have gone very differently.The Congress\' internal calculations indicate that besides the Gandhi family strongholds of Amethi and Raebareli, they have a good chance in seats like Unnao, Kanpur, Barabanki, Pratapgarh and some seats in western UP.Congress strategists have emphasised that they are positioning the party to get upper caste votes. One of the key groups that are upset with the government is the Brahmins and party strategists indicate that they hope to cash in on it. The selective approach will also avoid any kind of conflict that they may have with the SP-BSP vote.21 COMMENTS']"

The opposition parties, she added, will meet every 15 days to fine-tune their strategy.Sources said part of the discussion was on a possible alliance between Mr Kejriwal\'s party and the Congress in Delhi. While the two parties are known for their political rivalry, the opposition leaders are arguing that a lack of an alliance in Delhi is likely to harm the unity agenda, sources said.Delhi has seven Lok Sabha seats, all of which were won by the BJP in the 2014 national elections. But in the subsequent assembly election, Mr Kejriwal\'s party had won big. The Aam Aadmi Party swept the 2015 elections, while the Congress drew a blank.The Congress-AAP dynamics had been skewed from the beginning, with Mr Kejriwal\'s party being an offshoot of the anti-corruption movement of Anna Hazare that had targeted the Congress government in Delhi led by Sheila Dikshit.Still, the two parties had entered a partnership in 2013, which ended with Mr Kejriwal\'s 49-day tenure as Chief Minister.The parties, which have been at loggerheads since, had to re-calibrate their stance after persuasion from opposition leaders -- Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, DMK chief MK Stalin and CPM\'s Sitaram Yechury. Co-opted into the united opposition, Mr Kejriwal even shared stage with Rahul Gandhi.The mega rally today was attended by leaders of 15 parties -- way below the 23 that had attended Ms Banerjee\'s January 19 rally in Kolkata. The other opposition leaders attending the meet include Mr Naidu and National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah.The big political statement of the day had come from Ms Banerjee, who said she would fight along with bitter political opponents the Congress and the Left to take on the BJP in the general elections.64 COMMENTS""In the coming days, we will fight unitedly. Whatever our fight with Congress and CPM, it will be in the state. At the national level, we will all fight together,"" Ms Banerjee said.

Our two pilots died. Sorry to say, but the programmes at HAL are running late by three-and-a-half years...parts of aircraft are falling off on the runway. Is this capability? On the other hand, we say that HAL is not getting the (Rafale) work,"" he said.The minister was referring to the death of two pilots in a crash of Mirage 2000 trainer aircraft in Bengaluru on February 1. The aircraft was on an ""acceptance sortie"" after an upgrade by the HAL.On claims by the Congress that the Modi government had favoured industrialist Anil Ambani\'s firm in the Rafale deal, the former Army chief said, ""In Rafale case, it is the French, who decided the offset firm. The objective of the offset is to allow the industry to thrive here...if their firm is not satisfied with HAL, it is their decision...it is not the decision of the Indian government.""The opposition is trying to rake up the Rafale issue as a counter to the Bofors deal, he said referring to the Rs 1,437-crore deal between India and Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors in 1986 for supply of 400 units of 155-mm Howitzer guns for the Indian Army.""In the 60s, we came up with an indigenous design of Hindustan Fighter 24 - Marut.

Party leaders told NDTV that they are in touch with the Samajwadi Party leadership and Priyanka Gandhi is likely to take forward the proposal for more seats directly with Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav.Akhilesh Yadav is open to negotiations, Samajwadi leaders told NDTV, but the challenge, they said, is convincing Mayawati. On record though, the parties are unwilling to comment on any possibility of renegotiations. ""This is something I cannot comment on,"" Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh Pramod Tiwari told NDTV.Priyanka Gandhi had handled the alliance negotiations with Akhilesh Yadav ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, but the results had been disastrous for both parties. Even so, while the Yadav junior had not ruled out future alliances, seat sharing talks for the last round of assembly elections in the heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh had proved a deal breaker.Akhilesh Yadav and more so Mayawati, were upset at the unyielding stance of local leaders of the Congress and cut the party out of the alliance in Uttar Pradesh, even if their lawmakers are supporting the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The Congress, since, announced that they will contest all 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, crucial for any party that hopes to rule at the Centre. As part of his commitment, Rahul Gandhi has dispatched his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and close aide Jyotioraditya Scindia to spearhead the party\'s poll preparations in the state.While Mayawati\'s Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi party had agreed to contest 38 seats each in Uttar Pradesh, Congress leaders now say they hope to convince Akhilesh Yadav to give them at least 8-10 seats.SP leaders, however, rule this out. ""If we are left with just 28 seats, it doesn\'t work out for us. It has to be adjusted between both parties,\'\' they said. There was, however, a disclaimer: ""But Akhilesh ji wants the best situation to defeat the BJP.\'\'An official spokesperson for the former UP Chief Minister said that such reports were ""speculative"".The window the Congress sees is because while the seats have been formalised between the BSP and the SP, they haven\'t announced them publicly just yet.Aparna Yadav, the sister-in-law of Akhilesh Yadav, has told NDTV that Priyanka Gandhi was an asset and if she was made the alliance\'s Chief Ministerial face in 2017, the elections could have gone very differently.The Congress\' internal calculations indicate that besides the Gandhi family strongholds of Amethi and Raebareli, they have a good chance in seats like Unnao, Kanpur, Barabanki, Pratapgarh and some seats in western UP.Congress strategists have emphasised that they are positioning the party to get upper caste votes. One of the key groups that are upset with the government is the Brahmins and party strategists indicate that they hope to cash in on it.

Chandrababu Naidu, who were earlier with the BJP-led NDA, and many others who later parted company and were now the strongest critics of the ruling dispensation.""Even Raj Thackeray is now speaking a different language and is highly critical of Prime Minister Modi,"" Mr Pawar said.On his part, Raj Thackeray has made serious attempts to dilute his ""anti-north Indian"" image and on December 2 last year attended a massive gathering of the Uttar Bhartiya Mahapanchayat Sangh.6 COMMENTSHe also took the opportunity of his son\'s wedding last month to invite the leaders of all major political parties including the Congress-NCP besides union ministers and Shiv Sena leaders.']"

The other two cities occupying prominent positions on the list are Kanpur and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s constituency of Varanasi, both in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh.The study, which comes as a wake-up call for India, also revealed that the country witnessed 50% more pollution than China this year. It is based on data studied over a 45-day period through October and November last year. Although environmental issues are currently not grabbing headlines, environmentalists believe that greater conversation could even turn it into an election issue.The study showed that Patna, Kanpur and Varanasi suffered from poor or severe air quality over 31 days between October and November, with particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels hitting 170 micrograms per cubic metre and above. PM 2.5 particles reduce visibility and cause serious health issues in the general populace, an issue that the government has been unsuccessfully trying to address for several years now.Lawmakers blamed the phenomenon on the winter. ""We have got the stats, and are worried about Patna. We have made an action plan for the capital city, and are trying to implement it. Brick kilns that do not conform to our norms have been banned. We have asked builders to cover structures under construction to ensure that the air is not further polluted, and asked for roads to be cleaned regularly,"" said Bihar Environment Minister Sushil Modi.Mr Modi also cited the location of the Ganga near the Bihar capital as a reason for the city failing to achieve the required environmental standards. ""Cities situated along rivers are usually the most polluted. There is a big mound near Patna, and when wind blows, the air brings in a lot of dust. This happens primarily in the winter,"" he said.The study places Delhi at number 4 on the list of most polluted cities.Dr S Tripathi of IIT Kanpur said China seemed to be doing much better than India as far as curbing pollution was concerned. ""There are several sources of pollution in India, such as household fumes, solid fuel burning, power plant emissions and trash burning, which have turned out to be major contributors. We need to do something about this. It is a matter of great concern,"" he said.International climate experts also echo similar concerns. ""India should see the connection between pollution, climate change and health. Pollution is a particularly big problem in its cities. Secondly, they need to look at the long-term development pathway, and figure out how India can be turned into a zero carbon emitter in the future,"" said European Climate Foundation chief Executive officer Laurence Tubiana.7 COMMENTSMs Tubiana also said that India can no longer afford to treat pollution and climate action as secondary topics in the prevailing political discourse.

"['Pune:Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh Wednesday raised questions over the ""capability and condition"" of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) amid the Congress\' claim that the Modi government denied the defence PSU an offset contract in the Rafale deal.Talking to reporters in Pune, the minister defended the Rafale deal, saying the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France was necessary to enhance the Indian Air Force\'s capabilities.""Look at the condition of HAL. Our two pilots died. Sorry to say, but the programmes at HAL are running late by three-and-a-half years...parts of aircraft are falling off on the runway. Is this capability? On the other hand, we say that HAL is not getting the (Rafale) work,"" he said.The minister was referring to the death of two pilots in a crash of Mirage 2000 trainer aircraft in Bengaluru on February 1. The aircraft was on an ""acceptance sortie"" after an upgrade by the HAL.On claims by the Congress that the Modi government had favoured industrialist Anil Ambani\'s firm in the Rafale deal, the former Army chief said, ""In Rafale case, it is the French, who decided the offset firm. The objective of the offset is to allow the industry to thrive here...if their firm is not satisfied with HAL, it is their decision...it is not the decision of the Indian government.""The opposition is trying to rake up the Rafale issue as a counter to the Bofors deal, he said referring to the Rs 1,437-crore deal between India and Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors in 1986 for supply of 400 units of 155-mm Howitzer guns for the Indian Army.""In the 60s, we came up with an indigenous design of Hindustan Fighter 24 - Marut. But the Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE), which was assigned to develop an engine for the aircraft, failed to do so and we had to look at importing the engine,"" he said.In order to get the engine, India approached the US, who gave an ""oversparred"" engine, leading to the death of many pilots, he said.""We had to scrap the programme. But later, the French approached us and our government allowed them to have a look at a static aircraft. Then they clicked several pictures of the aircraft and on that basis the series of Mirage aircraft started,"" he said.""Had the then government compelled the GTRE to develop the engine, the country would have got its own aircraft and with advancements in technology, the country\'s indigenous aircraft would have been better than Rafale,"" he said.""If they are accusing the present government on the Rafale deal, then the blame for the failure of HF-24 should go to the then government and I would like to call it treason as the entire data of HF-24 was wiped off without anybody\'s knowledge,"" he said.Matters related to national security should not be politicised, the minister said, adding that India requires these 36 (Rafale) aircraft, in the absence of which the capability of the Indian Air Force will be hampered.""It was necessary to purchase these 36 aircraft as the capabilities of the Indian Air force were depleting.

Pre-poll alliance so there is no difficulty afterwards,” Ms Banerjee said after a 15-party meeting at NCP leader Sharad Pawar\'s Delhi home.The Bengal Chief minister, however, said the question of alliance in Bengal and Delhi has “not been decided yet”. Rahul Gandhi\'s comment confirmed the lingering contradiction in states where his Congress party is a rival to both Mamata Banerjee\'s Trinamool Congress and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal\'s Aam Aadmi Party. “We will compete with each other as well,” Mr Gandhi said, indicating that his party is willing to go it alone in both states.The three leaders are expected to work closely together despite their earlier differences, to form a united front against the BJP in the coming general elections. Discussions are also on for a Common Minimum Programme, Ms Banerjee said after the meeting, which took place after a day-long show of strength at Delhi\'s Jantar Mantar. The opposition parties, she added, will meet every 15 days to fine-tune their strategy.Sources said part of the discussion was on a possible alliance between Mr Kejriwal\'s party and the Congress in Delhi. While the two parties are known for their political rivalry, the opposition leaders are arguing that a lack of an alliance in Delhi is likely to harm the unity agenda, sources said.Delhi has seven Lok Sabha seats, all of which were won by the BJP in the 2014 national elections. But in the subsequent assembly election, Mr Kejriwal\'s party had won big. The Aam Aadmi Party swept the 2015 elections, while the Congress drew a blank.The Congress-AAP dynamics had been skewed from the beginning, with Mr Kejriwal\'s party being an offshoot of the anti-corruption movement of Anna Hazare that had targeted the Congress government in Delhi led by Sheila Dikshit.Still, the two parties had entered a partnership in 2013, which ended with Mr Kejriwal\'s 49-day tenure as Chief Minister.The parties, which have been at loggerheads since, had to re-calibrate their stance after persuasion from opposition leaders -- Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, DMK chief MK Stalin and CPM\'s Sitaram Yechury. Co-opted into the united opposition, Mr Kejriwal even shared stage with Rahul Gandhi.The mega rally today was attended by leaders of 15 parties -- way below the 23 that had attended Ms Banerjee\'s January 19 rally in Kolkata. The other opposition leaders attending the meet include Mr Naidu and National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah.The big political statement of the day had come from Ms Banerjee, who said she would fight along with bitter political opponents the Congress and the Left to take on the BJP in the general elections.64 COMMENTS""In the coming days, we will fight unitedly.

It does not include the controversial and key point of pricing, as the Defence Ministry maintained that these details could not be revealed.

The other two cities occupying prominent positions on the list are Kanpur and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s constituency of Varanasi, both in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh.The study, which comes as a wake-up call for India, also revealed that the country witnessed 50% more pollution than China this year. It is based on data studied over a 45-day period through October and November last year. Although environmental issues are currently not grabbing headlines, environmentalists believe that greater conversation could even turn it into an election issue.The study showed that Patna, Kanpur and Varanasi suffered from poor or severe air quality over 31 days between October and November, with particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels hitting 170 micrograms per cubic metre and above. PM 2.5 particles reduce visibility and cause serious health issues in the general populace, an issue that the government has been unsuccessfully trying to address for several years now.Lawmakers blamed the phenomenon on the winter. ""We have got the stats, and are worried about Patna. We have made an action plan for the capital city, and are trying to implement it. Brick kilns that do not conform to our norms have been banned. We have asked builders to cover structures under construction to ensure that the air is not further polluted, and asked for roads to be cleaned regularly,"" said Bihar Environment Minister Sushil Modi.Mr Modi also cited the location of the Ganga near the Bihar capital as a reason for the city failing to achieve the required environmental standards. ""Cities situated along rivers are usually the most polluted. There is a big mound near Patna, and when wind blows, the air brings in a lot of dust. This happens primarily in the winter,"" he said.The study places Delhi at number 4 on the list of most polluted cities.Dr S Tripathi of IIT Kanpur said China seemed to be doing much better than India as far as curbing pollution was concerned. ""There are several sources of pollution in India, such as household fumes, solid fuel burning, power plant emissions and trash burning, which have turned out to be major contributors. We need to do something about this. It is a matter of great concern,"" he said.International climate experts also echo similar concerns. ""India should see the connection between pollution, climate change and health. Pollution is a particularly big problem in its cities. Secondly, they need to look at the long-term development pathway, and figure out how India can be turned into a zero carbon emitter in the future,"" said European Climate Foundation chief Executive officer Laurence Tubiana.7 COMMENTSMs Tubiana also said that India can no longer afford to treat pollution and climate action as secondary topics in the prevailing political discourse. ""You have to see the health issues. This has to be part of the election debate, alongside employment and poverty reduction,"" she said.']"

Party leaders told NDTV that they are in touch with the Samajwadi Party leadership and Priyanka Gandhi is likely to take forward the proposal for more seats directly with Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav.Akhilesh Yadav is open to negotiations, Samajwadi leaders told NDTV, but the challenge, they said, is convincing Mayawati. On record though, the parties are unwilling to comment on any possibility of renegotiations. ""This is something I cannot comment on,"" Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh Pramod Tiwari told NDTV.Priyanka Gandhi had handled the alliance negotiations with Akhilesh Yadav ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, but the results had been disastrous for both parties. Even so, while the Yadav junior had not ruled out future alliances, seat sharing talks for the last round of assembly elections in the heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh had proved a deal breaker.Akhilesh Yadav and more so Mayawati, were upset at the unyielding stance of local leaders of the Congress and cut the party out of the alliance in Uttar Pradesh, even if their lawmakers are supporting the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The Congress, since, announced that they will contest all 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, crucial for any party that hopes to rule at the Centre. As part of his commitment, Rahul Gandhi has dispatched his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and close aide Jyotioraditya Scindia to spearhead the party\'s poll preparations in the state.While Mayawati\'s Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi party had agreed to contest 38 seats each in Uttar Pradesh, Congress leaders now say they hope to convince Akhilesh Yadav to give them at least 8-10 seats.SP leaders, however, rule this out. ""If we are left with just 28 seats, it doesn\'t work out for us. It has to be adjusted between both parties,\'\' they said. There was, however, a disclaimer: ""But Akhilesh ji wants the best situation to defeat the BJP.\'\'An official spokesperson for the former UP Chief Minister said that such reports were ""speculative"".The window the Congress sees is because while the seats have been formalised between the BSP and the SP, they haven\'t announced them publicly just yet.Aparna Yadav, the sister-in-law of Akhilesh Yadav, has told NDTV that Priyanka Gandhi was an asset and if she was made the alliance\'s Chief Ministerial face in 2017, the elections could have gone very differently.The Congress\' internal calculations indicate that besides the Gandhi family strongholds of Amethi and Raebareli, they have a good chance in seats like Unnao, Kanpur, Barabanki, Pratapgarh and some seats in western UP.Congress strategists have emphasised that they are positioning the party to get upper caste votes. One of the key groups that are upset with the government is the Brahmins and party strategists indicate that they hope to cash in on it. The selective approach will also avoid any kind of conflict that they may have with the SP-BSP vote.21 COMMENTS']"

Discussions are also on for a Common Minimum Programme, Ms Banerjee said after the meeting, which took place after a day-long show of strength at Delhi\'s Jantar Mantar. The opposition parties, she added, will meet every 15 days to fine-tune their strategy.Sources said part of the discussion was on a possible alliance between Mr Kejriwal\'s party and the Congress in Delhi. While the two parties are known for their political rivalry, the opposition leaders are arguing that a lack of an alliance in Delhi is likely to harm the unity agenda, sources said.Delhi has seven Lok Sabha seats, all of which were won by the BJP in the 2014 national elections. But in the subsequent assembly election, Mr Kejriwal\'s party had won big. The Aam Aadmi Party swept the 2015 elections, while the Congress drew a blank.The Congress-AAP dynamics had been skewed from the beginning, with Mr Kejriwal\'s party being an offshoot of the anti-corruption movement of Anna Hazare that had targeted the Congress government in Delhi led by Sheila Dikshit.Still, the two parties had entered a partnership in 2013, which ended with Mr Kejriwal\'s 49-day tenure as Chief Minister.The parties, which have been at loggerheads since, had to re-calibrate their stance after persuasion from opposition leaders -- Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, DMK chief MK Stalin and CPM\'s Sitaram Yechury. Co-opted into the united opposition, Mr Kejriwal even shared stage with Rahul Gandhi.The mega rally today was attended by leaders of 15 parties -- way below the 23 that had attended Ms Banerjee\'s January 19 rally in Kolkata.

""She is a natural in politics and I remember that day when in a joint press conference they announced Sheila Dikshit as the chief ministerial face. If at that time they had announced Priyanka Gandhi, it would have been a different story.""Aparna Yadav, 30, has kept many guessing about her own political choices too. The UK university-educated wife of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav\'s half-brother Prateek has been seen to be ranged against her brother-in-law.She supported Akhilesh Yadav\'s uncle Shivpal Yadav who, after a major falling out with the former UP chief minister, quit the Samajwadi Party. However, she ruled out joining Shivpal Yadav\'s new outfit, the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party. ""We will give chachaji all the support that he needs. However, in the 2019 elections, my job is to look after Netaji\'s (Mulayam Singh Yadav\'s) Mainpuri constituency and help him win.""In the run-up to the UP election two years ago, Aparna Yadav rattled her party with her praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s style. After the BJP\'s Yogi Adityanath took over as Chief Minister, she met with the saffron-robed monk-politician and greeted him with flowers. Heading into the national election due by May, she has expressed support for the building of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, which has been at the forefront of BJP\'s poll narrative in recent months. This led many to ask if she was keen on joining the BJP. ""Let\'s see what happens,\'\' she told NDTV. Asked about contesting the election as a Samajwadi candidate, she said- ""I have spoken to Bhaiyya (Akhilesh) and if they give me a good seat, I would like to fight for that.""Aparna Yadav claims that the Samajwadi party\'s grand alliance with Mayawati\'s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is facing some major challenges. ""Mayawati ji and Bhaiyya have told the workers but in most places they are not working together. Because they have been always fighting against each other, that seems to be continuing,"" she said.This would not be fixed, she asserted, until the leadership acknowledged the problem. ""You can only deal with it if you say there is a problem, which I don\'t think is happening right now,"" she said.Sources told NDTV that more than the workers\' rivalry, one key issue is that both Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav are yet to announce the seats they will contest.

""If they had been so serious, they could have announced them in the last Budget itself. Now, announcement of these programmes is only meant for elections. It shows it is their election manifesto and not the Budget,"" the party\'s M Thambidurai had said.The BJP, looking to gain ground in the 39-seat state, has for over a year been pursuing the AIADMK, which is seen to be greatly weakened and riven by feuding after the death of its charismatic chief J Jayalalithaa in 2016. Its rival DMK has already announced that it will partner with the Congress.A series of income tax and CBI raids on the state Health Minister, Chief Secretary and the police chief meant that the AIADMK virtually surrendered itself to the BJP.In the past few months, the AIADMK was seen to be changing its stand on any alliance with the BJP, with Mr Thambidurai saying, ""The BJP had not done anything for Tamil Nadu. We will align only with a party that is good for the state"".In the 2014 national election, the AIADMK won 37 seats in the state. The BJP, snubbed by Jayalalithaa, formed an alliance with parties like MDMK, PMK and DMDK but ended up with just two seats.This time, the AIADMK is split in two, with a rebel faction supporting Jayalalithaa\'s long-time aide VK Sasikala, who made a failed bid to take over the party and chief ministership after her death, before being jailed for corruption. Sasikala\'s nephew TTV Dhinakaran has launched AMMK and even won Jayalalithaa\'s RK Nagar constituency in a by-election.But then again, last week, the AIADMK hinted that a tie-up with the BJP was definitely brewing.

Many remote villages in this South Gujarat region recognise only the Congress\' hand symbol and remember only former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.Not losing out on the fact that the Congress attaches historic importance to this region, the Bharatiya Janata Party moved in Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis from neighbouring Maharashtra to Dharampur on Wednesday, a day ahead of Rahul Gandhi\'s Jan Akrosh Rally, to galvanise over 4,000 party workers at a \'cluster meeting\' of the party\'s rank and file in presence of state chief Jitu Vaghani.The meeting, held at Rajchandra Ashram hall in Dharampur, was to address party workers of three Lok Sabha constituencies in South Gujarat dominated by Adivasis.Mr Fadnavis told party workers that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government had got a clean chit on the Rafale fighter jet deal from the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) while the Congress leaders\' hands were sullied in AugustaWestland chopper deal.Rahul Gandhi, meanwhile, was expected to make a strong statement against land acquisition for the bullet train in this region where angry farmers who are losing their fertile fields are locked in a battle with the government, the matter now awaiting a judgment in the Gujarat High Court.Sources say there is also a move to hold a meeting of the party\'s highest decision making body, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), in South Gujarat to demonstrate the importance the party gives to the state.The decision to choose Gujarat over the Congress ruled states indicates the party stand.This is besides Rahul Gandhi choosing to walk in the footsteps of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi in Lal Dungri.Though Mr Fadnavis\' Dharampur visit was announced by the party only on Tuesday, BJP Gujarat General Secretary Bharatsinh Parmar insisted their meeting had been fixed earlier than the Congress rally.The Congress party had announced to hold its \'Jan Akrosh\' rally from here on February 6.The Congress has pulled out all stops for the Lal Dungri rally and the state unit has galvanised its 75 legislators to ensure a big show.

The lack of an alliance in Delhi could harm the picture of unity, the two were told.The BJP won all seven parliamentary seats in Delhi in the 2014 national election. Since then, it is AAP that has won more in the capital. The party swept the 2015 Delhi election in which the Congress scored a duck.Ties between the Congress and AAP have never been easy. AAP was born out of the anti-corruption movement of Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal, which became a big headache for the Congress-led central government.In 2013, the Congress helped AAP take power in Delhi, but Mr Kejriwal quit after a 49-day stint over the anti-corruption Lokpal bill. Two years later, AAP returned to power with a spectacular mandate and the Congress was wiped out.Ajay Maken, as the Congress\'s Delhi chief for four years, was firmly opposed to any alliance with AAP, believing that it would weaken Congress further. After Mr Maken\'s resignation in January, there was speculation that the Congress was inclined towards a tie-up with AAP but former chief minister Sheila Dikshit, who was appointed Delhi chief, ruled it out.12 COMMENTSCongress leaders do not assess any gain from a tie-up with AAP.

But in the subsequent assembly election, Mr Kejriwal\'s party had won big. The Aam Aadmi Party swept the 2015 elections, while the Congress drew a blank.The Congress-AAP dynamics had been skewed from the beginning, with Mr Kejriwal\'s party being an offshoot of the anti-corruption movement of Anna Hazare that had targeted the Congress government in Delhi led by Sheila Dikshit.Still, the two parties had entered a partnership in 2013, which ended with Mr Kejriwal\'s 49-day tenure as Chief Minister.The parties, which have been at loggerheads since, had to re-calibrate their stance after persuasion from opposition leaders -- Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, DMK chief MK Stalin and CPM\'s Sitaram Yechury. Co-opted into the united opposition, Mr Kejriwal even shared stage with Rahul Gandhi.The mega rally today was attended by leaders of 15 parties -- way below the 23 that had attended Ms Banerjee\'s January 19 rally in Kolkata.

Party leaders told NDTV that they are in touch with the Samajwadi Party leadership and Priyanka Gandhi is likely to take forward the proposal for more seats directly with Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav.Akhilesh Yadav is open to negotiations, Samajwadi leaders told NDTV, but the challenge, they said, is convincing Mayawati. On record though, the parties are unwilling to comment on any possibility of renegotiations. ""This is something I cannot comment on,"" Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh Pramod Tiwari told NDTV.Priyanka Gandhi had handled the alliance negotiations with Akhilesh Yadav ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, but the results had been disastrous for both parties. Even so, while the Yadav junior had not ruled out future alliances, seat sharing talks for the last round of assembly elections in the heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh had proved a deal breaker.Akhilesh Yadav and more so Mayawati, were upset at the unyielding stance of local leaders of the Congress and cut the party out of the alliance in Uttar Pradesh, even if their lawmakers are supporting the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The Congress, since, announced that they will contest all 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, crucial for any party that hopes to rule at the Centre. As part of his commitment, Rahul Gandhi has dispatched his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and close aide Jyotioraditya Scindia to spearhead the party\'s poll preparations in the state.While Mayawati\'s Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi party had agreed to contest 38 seats each in Uttar Pradesh, Congress leaders now say they hope to convince Akhilesh Yadav to give them at least 8-10 seats.SP leaders, however, rule this out. ""If we are left with just 28 seats, it doesn\'t work out for us. It has to be adjusted between both parties,\'\' they said. There was, however, a disclaimer: ""But Akhilesh ji wants the best situation to defeat the BJP.\'\'An official spokesperson for the former UP Chief Minister said that such reports were ""speculative"".The window the Congress sees is because while the seats have been formalised between the BSP and the SP, they haven\'t announced them publicly just yet.Aparna Yadav, the sister-in-law of Akhilesh Yadav, has told NDTV that Priyanka Gandhi was an asset and if she was made the alliance\'s Chief Ministerial face in 2017, the elections could have gone very differently.The Congress\' internal calculations indicate that besides the Gandhi family strongholds of Amethi and Raebareli, they have a good chance in seats like Unnao, Kanpur, Barabanki, Pratapgarh and some seats in western UP.Congress strategists have emphasised that they are positioning the party to get upper caste votes. One of the key groups that are upset with the government is the Brahmins and party strategists indicate that they hope to cash in on it. The selective approach will also avoid any kind of conflict that they may have with the SP-BSP vote.21 COMMENTS']"

On record though, the parties are unwilling to comment on any possibility of renegotiations. ""This is something I cannot comment on,"" Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh Pramod Tiwari told NDTV.Priyanka Gandhi had handled the alliance negotiations with Akhilesh Yadav ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, but the results had been disastrous for both parties. Even so, while the Yadav junior had not ruled out future alliances, seat sharing talks for the last round of assembly elections in the heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh had proved a deal breaker.Akhilesh Yadav and more so Mayawati, were upset at the unyielding stance of local leaders of the Congress and cut the party out of the alliance in Uttar Pradesh, even if their lawmakers are supporting the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The Congress, since, announced that they will contest all 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, crucial for any party that hopes to rule at the Centre. As part of his commitment, Rahul Gandhi has dispatched his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and close aide Jyotioraditya Scindia to spearhead the party\'s poll preparations in the state.While Mayawati\'s Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi party had agreed to contest 38 seats each in Uttar Pradesh, Congress leaders now say they hope to convince Akhilesh Yadav to give them at least 8-10 seats.SP leaders, however, rule this out.

There was, however, a disclaimer: ""But Akhilesh ji wants the best situation to defeat the BJP.\'\'An official spokesperson for the former UP Chief Minister said that such reports were ""speculative"".The window the Congress sees is because while the seats have been formalised between the BSP and the SP, they haven\'t announced them publicly just yet.Aparna Yadav, the sister-in-law of Akhilesh Yadav, has told NDTV that Priyanka Gandhi was an asset and if she was made the alliance\'s Chief Ministerial face in 2017, the elections could have gone very differently.The Congress\' internal calculations indicate that besides the Gandhi family strongholds of Amethi and Raebareli, they have a good chance in seats like Unnao, Kanpur, Barabanki, Pratapgarh and some seats in western UP.Congress strategists have emphasised that they are positioning the party to get upper caste votes.

They left before Ms Banerjee was expected onstage at 3 pm. But they have never come so close to sharing a stage ever before.The other first was Trinamool lawmakers protesting outside parliament and adopting Rahul Gandhi\'s slogan against Prime Minister Modi: ""Chowkidar chor hai"". It was only on Saturday that Mamata Banerjee had given cognizance to the Congress fight against PM Modi on the Rafale issue.Chalking out a draft plan for the battle ahead, Ms Banerjee reiterated the need to field one opposition candidate against the BJP candidate. ""Fight where you are strong,"" she said. ""Nothing will happen to me. We are used to fighting Congress, BJP, CPM. They all fight together. Even if we have an understanding, they will not do a vote transfer, that is their habit. However had they fight, I will get 42 on 42 seats."" Ms Banerjee\'s claim may sound tall but she is a formidable political fighter. Her Trinamool Congress ended the 34-year rule of the Left Front in Bengal. The Trinamool has reduced Ms Banerjee\'s parent party, the Congress into a ""signboard"" in Bengal. There is no love lost between the two sides and, this morning, in parliament, senior Congress lawmaker from Bengal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, launched a scathing attack on the Trinamool over the Saradha Ponzi scheme.

Although covered under the quota for Other Backward Classes, they demanded an extra 5 per cent quota for the community.Efforts have been made twice by BJP-led governments in the state to grant that quota under various heads. But it has been repeatedly struck down by the Rajasthan High Court.The last such effort was made in 2017, when the Vasundhara Raje government gave Gujjars 5 per cent reservation as a Most Backward Class and expanded the OBC quota to 26 per cent.""We know that five per cent reservation has been overturned in the past.
