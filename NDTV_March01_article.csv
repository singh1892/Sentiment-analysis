Otherwise, we will continue with the present situation and the things are not going to improve,"" Mr Sinha warned.Stating that there are various other issues on which the conventions of the Constitution, which have been established over the last seven decades, they have been violated with impunity by this government.Flaying PM Modi for the politicizing the National War Memorial at India Gate, he said, ""can you imagine the Prime Minister going to inaugurate the War Memorial and uses that occasion for petty politics?

But does anyone cares it now?""There is a very healthy rule that no policy statement will be made outside Parliament when Parliament is in session. But are we observing that rule? We have all accepted all these as if nothing has happened.

Now, the highest court of the land is compromised...Still it\'\'s business as usual for the civil society. It is very sad.""There are various areas where as citizens of a free democracy must assert their rights to tell the government of the day where they are wrong and where they must get off, Mr Sinha said.Addressing the same event, former SEBI chairman M Damodaran said think civil society needs to frame issues better. We need to recognise that all problems won\'\'t be solved overnight so we need to prioritise the sequence, frame the issues and approach them right.5 COMMENTSHe also said today institutions have lost self respect as they function as if they are attached of subordinate offices.

"['New Delhi:Political sparring over an event organised by the ruling BJP amid India-Pakistan tensions inspired the hashtag #MeraJawanSabseMajboot, which outdid its rivals on Twitter\'s trending list on Thursday by its sheer simplicity and stickiness. It was born as a counter to #MeraBoothSabseMajboot, the BJP\'s tagline for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s video conference with millions of party workers ahead of the national election due by May.The hashtag turned out to be quite versatile. Within hours, it was being used by those supporting the Narendra Modi government\'s decision to launch air strikes on terror camps in Pakistan as well as others who did not favour the escalation of tensions between the two countries.A user on Twitter, Hrishikesh Saikia, posted a photograph of Pakistan Lieutenant-General AAK Niazi signing the instrument of surrender under Indian Lieutenant General JS Aurora\'s gaze after the 1971 war, captioning it with the word ""Again"" apparently to suggest that Pakistan had decided to release captured Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman under pressure from India. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had said in a parliamentary address that his government would return the pilot on Friday as a ""gesture of peace"".Another user, Aastha Varma, claimed that Pakistan was acting in a hypocritical manner by blacking out Karachi, stopping the Samjhauta Express, violating the ceasefire at 6 am and 1 pm, encroaching into Indian air space and making false declarations in the press conference, all the while talking about ""restraint and peace"".Others simply celebrated Pakistan\'s decision to release the pilot or accused the ruling BJP of exploiting the situation for political mileage. Sneh Pandit tweeted a video of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announcing that Wing Commander Varthaman would be released soon, and captioned it with the question: ""Has Modi started taking credit for this yet in his ongoing election rallies???""""#Abhinandan will be Released tomorrow by Pak as a Peace Gesture!

"['New Delhi:The Delhi High Court Thursday dismissed a plea by Congress lawmaker Jairam Ramesh challenging the amendments made to the anti-money laundering law since 2015.A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao rejected the plea in which Ramesh said that the amendments were done in violation of the Constitution as they were enacted as money bills.The court had on Wednesday reserved its order after hearing arguments on behalf of the Congress leader and the Centre.It had said that it would consider the petition.In the petition, the Rajya Sabha MP has said that prior to the present regime at the Centre such amendments were part of an ordinary bill.A money bill is a piece of legislation which can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject it. The Upper House can only make recommendations which may or may not be accepted by the Lower House.Senior advocate P Chidambaram and advocate Abhishek Jebraj, appearing for the Congress leader, had told the court that the amendments made to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) were ""unconstitutional"" and ""illegal"" as they have no relation to the money bill provisions enumerated in Article 110 of the Constitution.""Passing the impugned amendments by way of a Money Bill is grossly illegal and is expressly ultra vires the Constitution of India. Such action bypasses the authority of the Upper House and is a desecration of bicameralism which forms an invaluable part of the basic structure of the Constitution,"" the petition has said.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Maninder Acharya and central government\'s standing counsel Amit Mahajan had questioned the locus of Ramesh to challenge the amendments and asked whether he has moved the petition on account of persons who have been accused of money laundering.They had said Mr Ramesh was in no way affected by the amendments to the PMLA and a person affected ought to have moved the court. COMMENTThe government lawyers had also said that there was no public interest in the matter.']"
"['Hyderabad:If things go as planned by the Telangana unit of the Congress, it could well be former cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin versus AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi for the Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat.The former India captain is the top pick of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) for the constituency. The party has shortlisted candidates for all the 17 Lok Sabha segments in Telangana, party sources said.The 56-year-old cricketer-turned-politician, who is from the city, was appointed one of the working presidents of the TPCC before the December 7, 2018 assembly elections in the state.There were earlier reports that Mohammad Azharuddin was keen to contest from Secunderabad - now held by senior BJP leader and former union minister Bandaru Dattatreya - in the Lok Sabha election due by May.But it now looks unlikely that he would get the party nod to fight from there.However, it\'s not immediately clear if Azharuddin is willing to throw his hat in the ring in Hyderabad constituency, an AIMIM stronghold, represented by Mr Owaisi for three terms now.""If the party high command asks him to contest from Hyderabad, he will do so"", a senior TPCC leader told PTI when asked if Mr Azharuddin was indeed in the race.The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has already made it clear that it would support Mr Owaisi in Hyderabad and expects his backing for its candidates in the remaining 16 segments.In the 2009 Lok Sabha poll, Mr Azharuddin won from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh but in 2014, lost from Tonk-Madhopur in Rajasthan.In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the ruling TRS won 11 seats, the Congress two, and the BJP, AIMIM, TDP and YSRCP one each in Telangana.In the assembly elections held nearly three months ago, the Congress had forged an electoral alliance -- ""Prajakutami"" (People\'s Front) -- with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS).But the grouping did not result in success.The Congress won a mere 19 seats and the TDP could get only two while the CPI and TJS drew a blank. The TRS was swept back to power, securing 88 seats in the 119-member House.The alliance landscape may look different for the coming Lok Sabha elections in Telangana.The Congress has decided to contest all the 17 seats and has reached out to the CPI, TJS and TDP requesting them to extend support to its candidates.But there are indications that CPI and CPI-M may join hands and field their candidates.A senior TJS leader said: ""A general feeling in the party is that we (TJS) should contest at least two or three seats. If as a party if we don\'t contest, we can\'t survive"". COMMENTA top Congress leader said his party was looking forward for ""indirect support"" from the TDP, led by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu.']"

The reference was to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in the aftermath of the terror attack in Pulwama, had attacked the Congress at the inauguration of the National War Memorial earlier this week.The opposition meeting at the parliament came amid a huge escalation in hostilities with Pakistan since yesterday\'s airstrikes on a Jaish-e Mohammed terror camp in Balakot by the Indian Air Force.
