new delhia number of opposition leaders on monday attended andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu\s day long fast and slammed prime minister narendra modi and his party over a host of issues. however what might pinch the most is sanjay raut\s surprise appearance at the congregation of opposition parties. the leader attended the event as a representative of the shiv sena amid strains with ally bjp. the bonhomie between the tdp chief and the bjp\s ally was made evident when mr naidu called sena chief uddhav thackeray his best friend.uddhav thackeray is the best friend of mine. even bal thackeray was very affectionate towards me. i really appreciate shiv sena chief for extending the cooperation mr naidu was quoted by news agency ani.mr naidu followed the praise with an attack on prime minister narendra modi. narendra modi is a vindictive leader with whom even shiv sena is not happy he added.the andhra chief minister\s one day fast to demand special status to his state was attended by opposition leaders like national conference chairperson farooq abdullah ncp\s majeed memon dmk\s tiruchi siva and loktantrik janata dal\s sharad yadav. congress leaders digvijaya singh and kamal nath were also in attendance.i took the principal stand to protect democracy to save the democracy. if there is no democracy neither i nor sanjay raut or digvijay singh would be able to talk anything which is very dangerous for the nation mr naidu added.the bjp and the shiv sena are allies in maharashtra and at the centre. however the two parties have maintained an acrimonious equation over the years. with lok sabha elections round the corner the bjp is trying to woo the party. the uddhav thackeray led party is however playing hardball saying it would go solo in the upcoming elections.the sena has been attacking the government over a host of issues. last year the party had backed the opposition\s demand of a jpc probe in the rafale jet deal. the most poignant attack came from mr thackeray when he repeated the congress slogan at a rally. chowkidaar chor hai\ he said at a rally in maharashtra\s pandharpur last year.earlier this month election strategist and bjp ally prashant kishor met sena chief uddhav thackeray and his son aditya thackeray. their discussions over lunch   photos of which were tweeted by thackeray junior    had caused much buzz in view of the coming elections.though sena leader sanjay raut had called it a courtesy visit the day after the visit there were newspaper reports that he had undertaken to have his team craft the campaign for the sena.mr kishor\s party had denied the reports.5 commentswith inputs from ani

patnajdu national vice president prashant kishor said on monday that narendra modi would return as the prime minister after lok sabha polls and though bihar chief minister nitish kumar was a big leader in the nda it was unfair to view him as a claimant for the top post even in the event of the bjp not getting a clear mandate.mr kishor who joined the jdu in september last year made the comments in response to queries about his recent visit to mumbai where he met shiv sena chief uddhav thackeray fuelling speculations about a strategic alliance between his party and the maharashtra based outfit which of late has been critical of pm modi\s leadership.a resident of buxar district in the state mr kishor shot to fame in 2014 when he managed the poll campaign for narendra modi then the prime ministerial candidate of the bjp which went on to put up its best ever electoral performance.a year later he collaborated with mr kumar who returned to power for his third consecutive term after registering a handsome victory in the assembly polls.i met the shiv sena chief upon his invitation. the party is an nda constituent and so there is nothing out of place in both of us thackeray and kishor having discussions. the speculations of my helping them with poll strategy do not have any substance. i am now a member of a party and cannot offer such professional assistance he told reporters.asked about the chances of nitish kumar becoming the prime minister and he the deputy pm in the event of the bjp falling short of adequate numbers mr kishor said no discussion of the sort took place. kumar is a big leader. anybody who has ruled a major state like bihar for close to 15 years is bound to have a stature. but it would be unfair to him if we start considering him a claimant for the prime minister\s post.narendra modi is the nda\s prime ministerial candidate and he will return as the prime minister again. nitish kumar will have a role to play of course. among nda constituents the jdu is the third largest after the bjp and the shiv sena. but nothing more should be read into this he added.mr kishor also said that during his meeting with mr thackeray whose party has often been accused of spreading hatred against the people from bihar the issue of the safety of biharis living in maharashtra was taken up. i said that in bihar the jdu would ensure the well being of maharashtrians and expressed hope that his party would respond in kind.to a query about allegations levelled by opposition parties that law and order had deteriorated in bihar in the recent times bringing disrepute to the nitish kumar government mr kishor said statistics speak otherwise.people often say it is the first term of kumar from 2005 2010 when the law and order situation was the best. perhaps it was because people experienced a welcome change from the days when bihar comprising only 10 per cent of the country\s total population witnessed more than 20 per cent of incidents of robberies and other crimes.1 commentstatistics say that the law and order situation today is even better than what it was during kumar\\s first tenure. but with people getting used to peace and order expectations soar and this is not something we can complain about but must gear up and face as a challenge he added.

chennaisenior congress leader p chidambaram on monday hit back at prime minister narendra modi for apparently calling him recounting minister insisting that there was no re count of votes in the 2009 lok sabha polls as was being said.p chidambaram wondered how many times can people in high places peddle a lie.in the 2009 elections in sivaganga constituency there was only one count and no re count. a simple check with the returning officer would have confirmed that there was no re count. how many times can people in high places peddle a lie mr chidambaram said in a tweet.the former union minister\s response came a day after pm modi taunted him as recounting minister of the upa regime during his public meeting at tirupur on sunday.citing his government\s step of offering tax exemption for those with income of up to rs. 5 lakh pm modi had said that it was a reflection of genuine concern for the middle class unlike the previous upa regime.referring to this pm modi had said he wanted to recall the state of affairs during the upa regime.there was a very wise minister from tamil nadu he said and told the audience you know whom i am talking about.when the people responded loudly he said right the recounting minister without naming the former union finance minister.p chidambaram now a rajya sabha mp won the 2009 lok sabha election from sivaganga constituency in tamil nadu by a slender margin of 3354 votes after a see saw battle.confusion had prevailed then as election officials delayed the declaration of the result due to a dispute in the counting of votes in respect of the final round.p chidambaram then home minister was declared elected after the votes were tallied again vis a vis the final round.3 commentspm modi had made the same recounting minister remark during his 2014 lok sabha election campaign as well.

dehradunbihar deputy chief minister sushil kumar modi today said prohibition cannot work everywhere as it did in his state.replying to a question on the recent hooch tragedy of uttarakhand in which many people from the state as well as neighbouring uttar pradesh died after drinking spurious liquor he said the incident was unfortunate and should not be linked with the feasibility of the idea of prohibition.over 60 people have died in two adjoining districts in uttarakhand and uttar pradesh with more people dying of the spurious liquor they drank at a haridwar village.more than 20 victims died in balupur and its neighbouring villages in haridwar district and around 40 have died in up\s saharanpur district.the bihar deputy cm was in the city in connection with the bjp\s month long bharat ke man ki baat modi ke saath campaign.prohibition may have worked in bihar but it cannot work everywhere. different states have different circumstances and it is up to their respective chief ministers to decide whether or not imposing prohibition will be a practical idea mr modi said.imposing prohibition in bihar was comparatively easier because liquor consumption was never a part of the bihari culture he said.it is not like this in all states. alcohol consumption is not a taboo in several of them. fathers and sons take it together mr modi said when asked whether prohibition should be imposed in uttarakhand in the wake of the hooch tragedy.pitching for stricter laws to punish people engaged in the manufacture and sale of illicit liquor the bihar deputy cm said it should be studied why such people should not be handed death sentence or life imprisonment.if someone can be hanged or sentenced to life in prison for murdering someone why shouldn\t those making spurious liquor be given similar punishment for killing dozens of unsuspecting people he asked.mr modi also claimed that a section of the bihari media legal and medical professionals are up in arms against the state government for bringing prohibition and want an end to it.but expressing the state government\\s resolve to fight the social evils of alcoholism dowry and child marriages he said it will not rest until they were totally eliminated.1 commentthe bjp on february 3 launched the bharat ke mann ki baat modi ke saath campaign to seek suggestions from people across the country to help the party prepare its \\sankalp patra\\ for the general election expected to be held in april may.
tiruppurprime minister narendra modi on sunday said that the congress governments in the past ignored the defence sector alleging that for them it was a sector of deals meant for supporting their own friends. he alleged the party was involved in several scams related to the sector adding it was his government that fulfilled the demand of one rank one pension orop.from the seas to the skies the congress has several scams associated with the defence sector and in the process the party did not allow the modernisation of defence forces for years they were in power pm modi said at a rally in tamil nadu\s tiruppur.those who got the opportunity to rule the nation for years did not bother about our defence sector. for them it was just a sector of deals and supporting their own friends he added.his government\s approach towards the defence sector is different he claimed.we dream of an india that is self sufficient in defence production and where our forces have all the possible support they require in keeping our nation safe he said.it was our government that had the honour of fulfilling the demand of one rank one pension which was pending for decades he added.the promise of welfare of personnel of the armed forces has been a regular feature in bjp manifestos. in 2014 the bjp had promised to implement orop. they fulfilled the promise but not to the satisfaction of a section of army personnel who said the government\s version of the scheme was different than theirs.orop has also been used by the bjp to target its biggest rival the congress. bjp president amit shah last month said the congress gave the country only rahul only priyanka.when the bjp government was formed within a year modi ji delivered on his promise of one rank one pension. modi ji gave orop to our jawans congress gave \only rahul only priyanka\ the bjp president had said after priyanka gandhi joined politics.pm modi\s attack came days after a report published by the hindu said that the defence ministry had expressed its strong reservations to parallel negotiations conducted by the prime minister\s office with france on the multi billion dollar rafale figher jet deal.the report created an uproar in political circles with congress president rahul gandhi launching a savage attack on pm modi. who do you think he\s doing parallel negotiations for not for you and me it is for anil ambani... this proves that chowkidaar is a thief he said.the bjp reacted to mr gandhi\s attack saying he was peddling lies.disclaimer ndtv has been sued for 10000 crores by anil ambani\s reliance group for its coverage of the rafale deal22 commentswith inputs from pti

kolkatanarendra modi will be the bjp\s prime ministerial candidate even if the ruling nda falls short of a majority in the lok sabha elections as his leadership qualities are unmatched uttar pradesh deputy chief minister keshav prasad maurya has said.he however asserted that the bjp will improve upon its performance in the 2014 polls and cross the 300 seat mark. the nda he claimed will clinch over 400 seats.speaking on the ram temple issue mr maurya said its construction in ayodhya was only a matter of time and that the centre will remove all the hurdles coming in the way. in 2014 we had won 282 seats. but in 2019 the bjp alone will cross 300 seats. with our nda partners we will cross the 400 mark under the leadership of narendra modi mr maurya was quoted by news agency told pti as saying.he insisted that pm modi will come to power as people trust only him.that the bjp won\t get a majority is a figment of imagination. those who are trying to pitch themselves as pm candidate like mamata banerjee can only dream that narendra modi won\t be getting a majority. the fact is that modiji will be elected as pm again with a massive majority he said.his comments come at a time when speculation is rife that union minister nitin gadkari considered close to the rss and who has acceptability across party lines might replace pm modi in the event of the nda failing to cross the majority mark in order to enlist the support of small parties and regional players averse to backing the current prime minister.speaking about the construction of ram temple in ayodha mr maurya said bricks inscribed with babur\s name won\t be allowed at the site of ram janmabhoomi.referring to the centre seeking permission of the supreme court to return the excess land aquired around the disputed ram janmabhoomi babri masjid site to original owners mr maurya said he is hopeful that the verdict will be in favour of the government.on whether the government will take steps for construction of ram temple ahead of the lok sabha polls he said building the shrine is the decision of the sadhus and devotees of the lord and that the government will only remove all the hurdles in the way.facing growing pressure to move swiftly on the ram temple issue the modi government last month asked the supreme court to allow it to return the non disputed surplus land acquired around the place where the disputed structure in ayodhya stood before its demolition to a hindu trust and other original owners in a significant move ahead of the lok sabha polls.the move could see some form of construction of a ram temple by hindu groups if the handover is allowed. the rss and other hindutva protagonists may pressure the centre to facilitate such a step.when asked whether the appointment of priyanka gandhi as congress general secretary in charge of eastern uttarpradesh would be factor in the lok sabha polls mr maurya said itwon\t have any impact and the opposition party will not be able to open its account in the state.5 commentshe said ideologically incompatible samajwadi partyand the bsp have formed an alliance in uttar pradesh out offear of pm modi.

new delhia day after over 70 people died after consuming poisonous liquor in uttarakhand and uttar pradesh congress leader priyanka gandhi vadra today said the state governments must take action against those responsible for the tragedy and offered her condolences to the families of those who died. the bjp is in power in uttarakhand and uttar pradesh.sad and stunned by the deaths... in uttarakhand and up due to illicit liquor. this is condemnable. it couldn\t have been imagined that the trade of illicit liquor flourished at such a large scale in the two states priyanka gandhi who last month was made in charge of the congress\s lok sabha election campaign in eastern uttar pradesh said in a statement today.the number of people who died after consuming poisonous liquor reached 75 on sunday 32 died in uttarakhand and 43 in uttar pradesh.more than 130 people have been arrested for making and selling illegal liquor the police said.the tragedy took a political turn with the ruling bjp and the opposition parties including the bahujan samaj party and the samajwadi party which have tied up for the national elections trading charges of negligence in enforcing strict liquor manufacturing and sale regulations.in the past too such type of mischievous acts by sp leaders had come to fore. in azamgarh hardoi kanpur and barabanki sp leaders were found to be involved in past hooch tragedies. we can\t deny conspiracy this time too chief minister yogi adityanath told reporters in gorakhpur according to news agency pti.former up chief minister akhilesh yadav said the bjp government did not listen to the opposition\s warning over illegal liquor trade. the opposition has been notifying the government about such activities but they did not act as some of its leaders are involved. the truth is that without the backing of the government such businesses cannot be carried out. the bjp should accept the fact that they cannot run the state mr yadav said.in saharanpur the up police claim the liquor was first consumed in neighbouring uttarakhand where villagers from saharanpur has gone to attend a funeral and was then also smuggled back to the saharanpur district by a villager who then sold it to others. in kushinagar the government says the liquor could have originated in bihar   where ironically there is total prohibition.if early treatment was taken then the death toll would be much lesser. the second thing is that a man called pintu came back with 30 pouches and sold them. one or two pouches have been recovered and anyone who drank from those pouches is also dead or in hospital saharanpur district magistrate ak pandey had said on saturday.uttar pradesh government has already suspended the district excise officer and district excise inspector of kushinagar among many others. many other police officers have also been suspended by the government.12 commentssince 2011 over 175 people have died in eight adulterated tragedies across up. four of those incidents have happened during yogi adityanath\s tenure as up chief minister.

against it and bring a government that gives justice.priyanka gandhi vadra and jyotiraditya scindia were recently appointed by him as congress general secretaries with charge of eastern and western up respectively keeping in mind the lok sabha elections expected to take place in april may.the congress party had fared miserably in the state during the 2014 lok sabha elections by winning just two of 80 seats in the state.using a cricket analogy he said the congress will play on the front foot and not on the back foot in the state.till a congress ideology government is installed here up we will not sit idle and ensure justice to the farmers the youth the poor he said.moving through major thoroughfares of the state capital atop a makeshift rath and braving teeming crowds rahul gandhi stopped in the lalbagh area to address bystanders.later on reaching the state congress headquarters he profusely thanked his partymen for the grand show.he said that for the congress there was no dearth of issues.there are issues after issues for the congress workers talk about corruption farmers employment... it is only a matter of moving ahead and fighting for the congress ideology and see what happens in uttar pradesh rahul gandhi stressed.the congress president who gave the important assignment to priyanka gandhi vadra and jyotiraditya scindia after the samajwadi party and the bsp cold shouldered him in the gathbandhan alliance for the coming lok sabha election reiterated that he has full respect for bsp chief mayawati and akhilesh yadav of sp.an alliance is also in the contest here and i have clearly said that i respect mayawatiji and akhilesh yadavji...but congress will fight with all its might for its ideology to change uttar pradesh rahul gandhi said.we will play on the front foot...till congress ideology government takes over here. we will not be sitting idle till we bring a government that works for the farmers youth and poor here he said.rahul gandhi who along with other leaders also inaugurated the congress media centre rajiv gandhi hall in the party headquarters asked party workers not to be afraid in this fight of ideology which is to connect people in the face of the challenge of the rss bjp and narendra modi who he alleged have been working to break and weaken the country.the congress began its journey from uttar pradesh and it cannot remain weak in the state...congress has to improve performance in up in the lok sabha polls and form government in the next assembly elections he stressed.in his address which was marked by chanting of chowkidar chor hai rahul gandhi alleged that in the last five years chowkidar has not provided employment he has just benefitted his friend anil ambani.people want congress government as they have tried all and they have failed and now there is only one way ahead...the battle will be fought on the ground he said adding that the grassroot workers and leaders will have to be given priority if the party has to be strengthened in the state.this is our responsibility to encourage the grassroot leaders and workers...those who fly in helicopters will not help rahul who has the enormous task of strengthening the organisation stressed.he also referred to pm modi\s claims of having 56 inch chest and that he wants to be the chowkidar of the country and said that the truth is coming out one after another and the hollowness of pm modi\s claims is coming out before the people.referring to a report on the hindu newspaper that critical provisions for anti corruption penalties and making payments through an escrow account were dropped days before the rafale deal rahul gandhi said in every defence deal there is a clause of corruption.1 commentthe government can act in case of corruption...but modi has cancelled it and given rs. 30000 crore to anil ambani he said.

her entry into politics as the party\s general secretary in charge of eastern uttar pradesh two weeks ago. reviving congress fortunes in the eastern part of uttar pradesh will be a symbolic victory

jawaharlal nehru\s lok sabha seat.the last two lok sabha elections in eastern uttar pradesh for the gorakhpur and phulpur constituencies were disastrous for the congress. congress candidates managed

lucknowhighlightspriyanka gandhi visits lucknow with congress chief rahul gandhi todayjyotiraditya scindia party\s western up in charge will also join themreviving party in up is a challenge given recent poll performanceswindow._pricee = window._pricee ||  _pricee.push{container  \_pcwgtmid\}priyanka gandhi vadra who is being hailed by many as the congress\ big hope in the make or  break state of uttar pradesh ahead of the lok sabha polls will finally arrive in lucknow this morning. rahul gandhi brother and congress president had announced her entry into politics as the party\s general secretary in charge of eastern uttar pradesh two weeks ago. priyanka gandhi will be accompanied by jyotiraditya scindia the party\s western uttar pradesh in charge and the congress chief on the occasion.tomorrow i hope that we can all come together to bring about a new kind of politics. a kind of politics in which all of you will be stakeholders. a kind of politics in which the voice of my youth friends my sisters and the poorest of the poor will be heard she told supporters through the party\s shakti app on sunday.the congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise priyanka gandhi\s lucknow visit. from lucknow airport all three leaders will proceed to the city\s congress office in a roadshow running well over 30 kilometres through some of the most congested areas of the city   garlanding statues of mahatma gandhi and br ambedkar along the way. congress leaders and workers will gather to welcome her and the others at 14 different points on the route and party workers from neighbouring districts have been called in to ensure good public presence.after reaching the congress office priyanka gandhi and the other leaders are expected to address a press conference and inaugurate a new media centre.the congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise priyanka gandhi\s lucknow visitover the next three to four days she is likely to frequent the party office and chair daily meetings on specific constituencies of the 40 odd lok sabha seats that fall under her purview. congress sources say that once priyanka gandhi is done with lucknow she may embark on a tour of eastern uttar pradesh instead of returning to delhibut while the congress believes that priyanka gandhi\s entry will boost its prospects in the lok sabha elections with her charisma and voter connect being touted as the major draws a reality check suggests that it could still be a daunting task. the last two lok sabha elections in eastern up   the gorakhpur and phulpur bypolls of 2018   turned out to be disastrous for the party. on both seats its candidates managed only about 19000 votes each and a 2% vote share in each constituency.the 2014 lok sabha polls was just as tragic for the congress bagging just two seats   amethi and raebareli   as compared to the 21 it had won five years earlier. the party\s vote share also dropped by almost 50% between 2009 and 2014. so the question is does priyanka gandhi have the time to revive the party\s seemingly defunct grassroots organisationsources say the party decided on priyanka gandhi\s foray into eastern uttar pradesh after much thought and the leadership believes that reviving it in eastern uttar pradesh would amount to achieving a symbolic victory.75 commentsallahabad or prayagraj as it is called now was lal bahadur shastri\s lok sabha seat and home to the nehru family. neighbouring phulpur was jawaharlal nehru\s lok sabha seat. east uttar pradesh also has the strongholds of both uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath and prime minister narendra modi and a good showing in a direct fight can boost the party\s morale immensely. failure is a possibility too but that\s a chance priyanka gandhi and her brother are willing to take.
new delhipriyanka gandhi vadra will complement congress president rahul gandhi\s efforts in winning over young voters and the brother sister combine will be a game changer for the party in the lok sabha polls as the country needs a young team technocrat turned politician sam pitroda said on sunday.he said the rahul gandhi priyanka gandhi vadra duo will make a great team along with many other young leaders active in the party including sachin pilot jyotiraditya scindia and milind deora as people who can take the country forward rather than keeping it hung up on history and religion.mr pitroda the indian overseas congress chief and a long time friend of the gandhi family also said rahul gandhi has learnt a lot from the 2014 elections and is much more mature stronger wiser and ready to take on the job of prime minister.in an interview with pti from chicago he said india needs a young person with a new inclusive vision of the future focus on employment and new opportunities for all to lead.india today needs somebody who believes in teamwork collaboration and cooperation as opposed to a centralised power centre. india today really needs someone who believes in truth rather than lies who believes in trust and not mistrust who believes in inclusion and not exclusion. rahul is at the right age to lead india mr pitroda said.asked about priyanka gandhi\s entry into active politics as aicc general secretary in charge of uttar pradesh east he said she will be a great asset and a good politician.she will complement her brother\s efforts. she will join him in getting young people excited especially women. they are both young they represent a large young team in the party they are modern they are tech savvy with a healthy respect for history and new vision for the future.i am confident that they will attract more young people in the mainstream and that is what a young india needs mr pitroda said.mr pitroda who divides his time between the us and india is seen as a key adviser of the gandhis.asked if the rahul priyanka team will be a game changer for the congress in the lok sabha polls expected in april may he said i think it will be. people will see the benefit of a younger team with a modern outlook. the country needs to look forward rather than backwards and not get hung up on history and religion.but it is not just the rahul priyanka combine. the party has many other young people like sachin pilot jyotiraditya scindia milind deora to name just a few he said.mr pitroda said he is hopeful that priyanka gandhi\s coming into active politics will have a big impact on the polls.priyanka gandhi 47 and mr scindia 48 took charge as aicc general secretary up east and up west respectively last week. mr pilot 41 was made deputy chief minister of rajasthan in december 2018 after the congress wrested power from bjp. he as well as mr deora 42 and mr scindia had served as union ministers in the last upa government at the centre.rahul gandhi 48 took charge as congress chief in december 2017.however the congress party has had several presidents who took charge at a younger age including his father rajiv gandhi grandmother indira gandhi and maternal great grandfather jawaharlal nehru as also maulana abul kalam azad.on the bjp\s charge that the congress was promoting dynastic politics mr pitroda said dynasty is in every business but ultimately it is the performance that matters. if you do not perform dynasty cannot help he said.rahul gandhi\s popularity has increased exponentially after becoming congress president because once he took over the party he has had a free hand mr pitroda said.he could do things that he wanted to do. earlier he was constrained in some ways. after becoming congress president he had to leave his mark bring in a young team respect the old guards and realise that going forward he would need new thinking and new blood and that is what he is trying to do said mr pitroda who headed the knowledge commission during the tenure of manmohan singh.he said gandhi has the qualities to make a good prime minister because his heart is in the right place and he is keen on working for the greater good of india and its people.he gandhi is not driven by personal and vested interests. he is driven by the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid. he is driven by opportunities for the young. he is driven by the welfare of farmers. he is driven by the idea of inclusion...he believes in the idea of india that our founding fathers had mr pitroda said.to a question on whether rahul gandhi\s nri events in foreign countries were similar to the ones prime minister narendra modi has had during his overseas visits he said it was not so and the idea behind the trips was not just to have big events with nris but to meet local political and business leaders interact with students interact with members of the indian overseas congress nris and then have a big event to be able to meet them en masse.he gandhi interacts with students wherever he goes so it is a different format mr pitroda said.mr pitroda who has worked closely with both rajiv gandhi and rahul gandhi said they cannot be compared as there is big difference between the india 35 years back and the india now but added that both were very open to new ideas.4 commentsmr pitroda led the telecom revolution under rajiv gandhi when he set up the c dot. he worked on the knowledge commission and also founded national innovation council later during the congress led upa rule.
new delhiformer congress leader sm krishna said on sunday that rahul gandhi was an extra constitutional authority in the government even when he was a nobody during the party\s rule. mr krishna who was the minister of external affairs between 2009 12 in the congress led government said due to a decision by mr gandhi he was forced to quit his post. he also claimed that former prime minister manmohan singh had no say in the allocation of ministerial portfolios.i was external affairs minister for 3.5 years and manmohan singh had no say over that portfolio. rahul gandhi was then a nobody not even a general secretary. he issued diktat that those who turned 80 can\t be a minister. when i heard that i submitted my resignation and came to bangalore mr krishna was quoted by news agency ani as saying at an event in karnataka\s maddur.sm krishna quit the congress in 2017 after over 50 years of his association with the party. he joined the party\s bitter rival the bjp.mr krishna claimed mr gandhi was not answerable to anyone in the government.there were matters that were never brought to the notice of even the ministers. the cabinet was in discussion over passing an ordinance. but rahul gandhi who was somewhere in public tore a copy of the ordinance to bits. this is what they call extra constitutional authority. he rahul gandhi was not answerable to anyone he added.the congress government had approved an executive order to protect politicians convicted of serious crimes from being evicted from parliament. in 2013 mr gandhi trashed the ordinance as nonsense and it was withdrawn by the cabinet.mr krishna further said the reason for the alleged scams during the congress rule was coalition politics.in my second tenure during upa i was minister for external affairs. i was also part of the cabinet joint responsibility framework. it was not a conducive environment for governance. there was a coalition government and because of that nobody could say anything to the other about their conduct. manmohan singh was the prime minister but had no control over his cabinet colleagues. it was during that period that scams broke out he said.rahul gandhi son of former prime minister rajiv gandhi and upa chairperson sonia gandhi became the congress president in 2017. the opposition often makes piercing attacks on his party\s dynasty politics alluding to a number of party presidents coming from mr gandhi\s family.prime minister narendra modi on friday made a reference to the congress\s alleged dynasty in parliament.there are two periods in time as far as india is concerned    bc and ad. bc stands for \before congress\ when nothing happened and ad for \after dynasty\ when everything happened he said.60 commentswith inputs from ani

new delhihighlightsindia doesn\t have data to implement the scheme rajiv kumarmr kumar also opposed the idea of universal basic incomecongress must explain how it can afford such scheme he saidwindow._pricee = window._pricee ||  _pricee.push{container  \_pcwgtmid\}calling the congress president rahul gandhi\s promise of a minimum income guarantee to poor unimplementable niti aayog vice chairman rajiv kumar says it is similar in nature to former prime minister indira gandhi\s garibi hatao slogan.he says india neither had the kind of fiscal space nor the kind of complete data needed to implement the scheme.mr kumar also opposed the idea of universal basic income often advocated by former chief economic adviser arvind subramanian saying he favoured incentives for population to work.the niti aayog vice chairman said the congress needed to explain to the country how it can afford a scheme like minimum income guarantee.i don\t think it is practical. i think it is more rhetorical. it is similar in nature to \garibi hatao\. and i don\t think its implementation will be feasible. we neither have that kind of fiscal space nor that kind of complete data that you need were you to be able to implement it mr kumar told ians in an interview.this is why i think the congress has left all details completely unclear and have only made a broad announcement he added.former finance minister p chidambaram has however said that the broad contours of the scheme justifying its feasibility would be explained in the congress manifesto.rejecting the idea of universal basic income for indians mr kumar said i have not been a supporter of the scheme. for india\s per capita income and its demographic profile i would much rather have incentives for work rather than incentives for being in on social security.i think a lot of countries especially something like china have done very well by empowering their young in employment rather than putting them on doles he said.the economist also defended the government\s newly launched rs 6000 direct income support to farmers and rejected criticism that the amount was too little.about it being too less the average income of a poor or marginal farmer household per month is probably in the range of rs 3000 to rs 4000. and in that context an additional rs 500 does not sound so little. it should not be dismissed neither should it be demeaned.this amount can be used by a farmer to send his child to school to buy rations to buy water from large land owners and so many other things. it\s not a small amount he said.another way to look at it is that in 10 years you get rs 60000. it\s not a one time sop. it\s a long term relief. in terms of government expenditure rs 75000 crore becomes rs 7.5 lakh crore in 10 years. it\s a fair significant fiscal burden he added.mr kumar said that one can always criticize a measure saying it is too little but it has to be balanced with fiscal responsibility.having seen poor households i don\t think the sum is too small. it is a significant percentage of total income not something that disappears in the decimal as you would tend think.he added the criticism that the scheme leaves out a large part of urban poor out of its net was also unfair and said only 13.7 per cent of farmers were tenants even out of which 80 per cent owned some land or the other.so hardly anyone is left out among the agriculture farming households. the only people who are not included are the landless labour. that is only 2.6 per cent of the rural population. that has been left out because for them there is mnrega. that is what gives them social security mr kumar said.the coverage is not narrow. it covers 12 crore households   around 60 crore people. it is much bigger than any farm loan waiver would cover which are by nature skewed or biased towards larger land owners.in a sharp criticism of loan waiver schemes announced by the newly formed governments in the hindi heartland states of rajasthan madhya pradesh and chattisgarh he said it was not the answer to agricultural distress.farm distress can be sorted out through true modernisation of the sector   convert farmer from mere producer of commodities to a producer of agricultural value products. the second part of solving the crisis is to connect the farmer to the market   get logistics in place.68 commentsand finally you have to lower the cost of production in agriculture. at the moment indian agriculture products are higher priced than global prices. there i think one has to move away from the model of increasing doses of chemical inputs into agriculture resulting in higher cost higher debt and higher distress. we need to shift to bio pesticides bio fertilizers mr kumar said.

her entry into politics as the party\s general secretary in charge of eastern uttar pradesh two weeks ago. reviving congress fortunes in the eastern part of uttar pradesh will be a symbolic victory for the party as allahabad has been home to the nehru family and was also former prime minister lal bahadur sastri\s lok sabha seat. neighbouring phulpur used to be india\s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru\s lok sabha seat.the last two lok sabha elections in eastern uttar pradesh for the gorakhpur and phulpur constituencies were disastrous for the congress. congress candidates managed to fetch only around 19000 votes each and registered only a 2% vote share in each constituency.eastern uttar pradesh currently has strongholds of both uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath and prime minister narendra modi.a 30 kilometre long roadshow is planned in lucknow as a grand welcome for the top three congress leaders through some of the most congested areas of the city.priyanka gandhi vadra will in the course of the next three days conduct daily meetings over specific constituencies of the 40 odd lok sabha seats which fall under her purview. sources say instead of returning

new delhihighlightsindia doesn\t have data to implement the scheme rajiv kumarmr kumar also opposed the idea of universal basic incomecongress must explain how it can afford such scheme he saidwindow._pricee = window._pricee ||  _pricee.push{container  \_pcwgtmid\}calling the congress president rahul gandhi\s promise of a minimum income guarantee to poor unimplementable niti aayog vice chairman rajiv kumar says it is similar in nature to former prime minister indira gandhi\s garibi hatao slogan.he says india neither had the kind of fiscal space nor the kind of complete data needed to implement the scheme.mr kumar also opposed the idea of universal basic income often advocated by former chief economic adviser arvind subramanian saying he favoured incentives for population to work.the niti aayog vice chairman said the congress needed to explain to the country how it can afford a scheme like minimum income guarantee.i don\t think it is practical. i think it is more rhetorical. it is similar in nature to \garibi hatao\. and i don\t think its implementation will be feasible. we neither have that kind of fiscal space nor that kind of complete data that you need were you to be able to implement it mr kumar told ians in an interview.this is why i think the congress has left all details completely unclear and have only made a broad announcement he added.former finance minister p chidambaram has however said that the broad contours of the scheme justifying its feasibility would be explained in the congress manifesto.rejecting the idea of universal basic income for indians mr kumar said i have not been a supporter of the scheme. for india\s per capita income and its demographic profile i would much rather have incentives for work rather than incentives for being in on social security.i think a lot of countries especially something like china have done very well by empowering their young in employment rather than putting them on doles he said.the economist also defended the government\s newly launched rs. 6000 direct income support to farmers and rejected criticism that the amount was too little.about it being too less the average income of a poor or marginal farmer household per month is probably in the range of rs. 3000 to rs. 4000. and in that context an additional rs. 500 does not sound so little. it should not be dismissed neither should it be demeaned.this amount can be used by a farmer to send his child to school to buy rations to buy water from large land owners and so many other things. it\s not a small amount he said.another way to look at it is that in 10 years you get rs. 60000. it\s not a one time sop. it\s a long term relief. in terms of government expenditure rs. 75000 crore becomes rs. 7.5 lakh crore in 10 years. it\s a fair significant fiscal burden he added.mr kumar said that one can always criticize a measure saying it is too little but it has to be balanced with fiscal responsibility.having seen poor households i don\t think the sum is too small. it is a significant percentage of total income not something that disappears in the decimal as you would tend think.he added the criticism that the scheme leaves out a large part of urban poor out of its net was also unfair and said only 13.7 per cent of farmers were tenants even out of which 80 per cent owned some land or the other.so hardly anyone is left out among the agriculture farming households. the only people who are not included are the landless labour. that is only 2.6 per cent of the rural population. that has been left out because for them there is mnrega. that is what gives them social security mr kumar said.the coverage is not narrow. it covers 12 crore households   around 60 crore people. it is much bigger than any farm loan waiver would cover which are by nature skewed or biased towards larger land owners.in a sharp criticism of loan waiver schemes announced by the newly formed governments in the hindi heartland states of rajasthan madhya pradesh and chattisgarh he said it was not the answer to agricultural distress.farm distress can be sorted out through true modernisation of the sector   convert farmer from mere producer of commodities to a producer of agricultural value products. the second part of solving the crisis is to connect the farmer to the market   get logistics in place.68 commentsand finally you have to lower the cost of production in agriculture. at the moment indian agriculture products are higher priced than global prices. there i think one has to move away from the model of increasing doses of chemical inputs into agriculture resulting in higher cost higher debt and higher distress. we need to shift to bio pesticides bio fertilizers mr kumar said.

bengalurucracking the whip the congress on monday sought disqualification of four rebel lawmakers under the anti defection law after they repeatedly remained defiant skipping the assembly session and legislature party meetings.the congress petitioned the assembly speaker ramesh kumar seeking action against lawmakers ramesh jarkiholi umesh jadhav mahesh kumathali and b nagendra weeks after giving them warnings to mend their ways and fall in line.congress legislature party leader and former chief minister siddaramaiah met the speaker and gave him a letter along with supporting documents to disqualify the four lawmakers.siddaramaiah who also heads the jds congress coordination committee was accompanied by deputy chief minister dr g parameshwara and congress state president dinesh gundu rao.later ms rao tweeted @siddaramaiah and myself have petitioned the hon\\ble speaker to disqualify 4 of our mlas under the rules of the anti defection law. despite repeated notices &amp issuing of whips they have been found to be in violation by their continued absence.the four lawmakers skipped the clp meeting on january 18 which was meant to be a show of strength in the backdrop of bjp\s alleged bid to topple the coalition government and another clp meet friday last despite a whip.they were also among those absent from the assembly since the budget session began wednesday last.jarkiholi was upset after he was dropped in the ministry rejig on december 22.the errant mlas were earlier given notices seeking an explanation for their conduct.another congress mla jn ganesh who was reportedly onthe bjp\s radar for desertion is absconding ever since he allegedly assaulted fellow lawmaker anand singh during a brawl at a resort recently.two independent mlas have already announced withdrawal of their support to the coalition government and backed bjp.a possible disqualification of the four mlas might deepen the crisis for the ruling coalition as in that event it would be hanging by the thread with its strength just above the half way mark of 113 by one seat. commentwith the two independent mlas withdrawing support the ruling coalition now enjoys the backing of 118 mlas in the 224 member house where the bjp\s strength is 104.

bengalururajasthan could see a 2004 like scenario after the coming lok sabha elections when congress rode back to power after eight years out of office deputy chief minister of that state sachin pilot said in bengaluru on sunday.most certainly the congress can ride back to power as it did in 2004 after being out of power for eight years.there is no way that the bjp will be able to hold on to some 100 seats in rajasthan gujarat delhi and uttar pradesh because the performance of their state and central governments is far from satisfactory he said at the huddle a thought conclave held by \\the hindu\\ in bengaluru.mr pilot said indian politics is unpredictable as nobody knew that the late prime minister atal behari vajpayee would lose by just one vote.likewise nobody thought that the congress would come back and form the government in 2004 he added. mr pilot said that the indian electorate is sophisticated and sometimes politicians misread and underestimate the competence of voters.as many as 130 crore people have been watching for the last four years and have been asking questions and getting no answers. it won\t be surprising if the mighty bjp has a fantastic fall he said.mr pilot said that bjp talks of nationalism mandir masjid ghar wapsi and love jihad but is silent on issues including food prices and national security.he also said that never before had various institutions in the country been \\devalued\\ like under the bjp.there is a deliberate and conscious effort in the last four years to devalue institutions. it will have far reaching consequences he added.asked if priyanka gandhi\s entry into politics would be a game changer mr pilot said that even before she officially took charge there was a sense of insecurity in bjp.she is just the general secretary of the congress not a chief minister or governor. why is it causing so much heartburn for the bjp the political uncertainty it has caused is telling me that they have a reason to fear he said.on bsp and sp ignoring congress to form an alliance in uttar pradesh for the coming lok sabha polls mr pilot said nothing was static in politics and the party was likely to perform better than 2009 in the state.uttar pradesh is very critical in the next lok sabha elections as it has 80 seats but the narrative needs to change mr pilot said.people are willing to give the mandate to the congress. we will do well much better than the other parties he said. asked if congress supported a woman dalit prime minister mr pilot said the party is pro women and pro dalit but winning adequate number of seats decides leadership issues.there has been no prime minister from the gandhi family for the past 35 years so it is wrong to say rahul gandhi is doing this to become one. congress has an equal presence in both northern and southern india he said.moreover bjp which was in power in the cow belt had now lost three states and there is a political messaging that is symbolic of things to come he added.asked what was the congress\ vision for the coming lok sabha elections mr pilot said the party manifesto would not be a book of \\jumlas\\ and various details including the promise of universal basic income wherever applicable would be placed before the people in the beginning of march.mr chidambaram is preparing the manifesto. at the end of the month we will have the draft of what congress wants to do. i promise you it would not be a book of jumlas.mr rahul gandhi has already promised universal basic income for entire country wherever applicable. details will be out very soon in the beginning of march he said.4 commentsmr pilot said india is an aspirational country and young people want a level playing field and opportunities.
tirupurprime minister narendra modi took a swipe at the congress today at a rally in tirupur saying the good work of the nda government has made some people very unhappy. those who thought power was their divine right those who thought only they are bound to rule are disturbed. because here is a government that is working. their unhappiness has turned into desperation and abuse pm modi said.taking potshots at the opposition for what he said was blaming him for every issue the prime minister said their answer for any question posed to them targeted him.be it agriculture or msme the answer will invariably be modi modi modi.he said it was the nda government which took the initiative to shut fake companies remove fake beneficiaries and ensure that middlemen no more roamed the corridors of power.without naming anyone he said that only in the services or products like mobile recharge or ice creams was the idea of a family pack seen. but now it applied for bail too.those who thought they could never be questioned who lorded over the nation are now having to give an account for the loot. this is what a change in india today.mocking at the grand opposition against his party he said our friends in the opposition are very funny.though the opposition called his government a failure and claimed it did nothing for the people and that he would be badly defeated still they have to form a big alliance to defeat modi.however what is the agenda of the so called alliance what are the issues they fight for nobody knows. because their guns are only aimed at me. this is \\maha milavat or adulteration.he asked if the people of tamil nadu and the rest of the country would ever accept an adulterated product never he said.the people of tamil nadu and the entire nation are seeing through this game pm modi said.the mahamilvat or adulterated alliance is a club of rich people trying to promote their dynasties. they neither understand poverty nor have a vision to serve the poor he said.the opposition is good at one thing and that is to spread panic. time and again they have tried to mislead farmers workers and youngsters.while the opposition talked of a poorly thought out loan waiver only during election his government took the step of announcing rs 6000 assistance annually to farmers to support them he said.in an apparent reference to senior congress leader p chidambaram prime minister narendra modi on sunday taunted him as a recounting minister\\ of the upa regime describing him as \\arrogant\\.citing his government\s step of offering tax exemption for those with incomes upto rs five lakh he told a public rally in tirupur that it was a reflection of genuine concern for the middle class unlike the previous upa regime.after referring to this step pm modi said he wanted to recall the state of affairs during the upa regime.there was a very wise minister from tamil nadu he said and told the audience you know whom i am talking about.when the people responded loudly he saidright the recounting minister without directly naming the former union finance minister.p chidambaram now a rajya sabha mp won the 2009 lok sabha election from sivaganga constituency in tamil nadu by a slender margin of 3354 votes after a see saw battle.confusion had prevailed then as election officials delayed the declaration of the result due to a dispute in the counting of votes in respect of the final round.p chidambaram then home minister was declared elected later after the votes were tallied again vis a vis the final round.pm modi had made the same recounting minister remark during his 2014 lok sabha election campaign.continuing his attack on p chidambaram pm modi said described him as the man who thinks all the knowledge in the world resides only in his brain. in his typical arrogance he says why is the middle class so worried about price rise when they buy such expensive ice cream and mineral water.mr recounting minister the middle class does not need the taunt by you and congress. they have rejected you and will continue to do so.34 commentsp chidambaram highly critical of the pm modi government had days ago targeted it on the row over the national sample survey organisation\\s data on high unemployment as per the report of a business daily and related developments.

new delhiwith the national election barely months away union minister arun jaitley has launched an all out attack on the congress. from terming the congress\ stand on multiple issues as self contradictory to calling the party as institution wreakers mr jaitley has shredded the charges and claims made by the grand old party in his latest blog the first since his return from the us where he was undergoing treatment.it congress slaughters a cow before the cameras in kerala and invokes the national security act against the cow killers in madhya pradesh mr jaitley said to highlight what he described as the party\s inconsistency.the post opens with criticism of the compulsive contrarians who continued to jump from one falsehood to another in the last two months.on the rs. 59000 crore rafale fighter jet deal mr jaitley said that the whole structure of the congress\ attack is based on falsehood.the rafale deal not only strengthens the combat ability of the indian air force but saved thousands of crores for the exchequer. when its falsehood collapsed a half document was produced to perpetuate the falsehood. little did the creators of this falsehood realise that the cost of producing half a document is loss of full credibility mr jailtley wrote.he was referring to a report by the hindu that cited an internal note of the defence ministry that expressed strong reservations about the parallel negotiations conducted by officials of the prime minister\s office.the central minister also claimed that the two speeches congress chief rahul gandhi made on the controversial rafale deal were based on his personal hatred of prime minister narendra modi. a failed student always hates the class topper the minister said.arun jaitley also accused rahul gandhi of damaging the parliament. history will record that pt. jawaharlal nehru\s great grandson has singularly damaged india\s parliament as an institution more than anyone else.the blog which is divided into sub heads rubbishes the opposition\s criticism of electronic voting machines and called it to be an attack on the election commission. all non bjp parties have been alleging that the evms can be tampered with and demanding the return of the ballot paper.the government has consistently maintained an arm\s length distance with the election commission. the evms were introduced when bjp was nowhere close to power. multiple parties have won and lost elections held through the evms. without producing a shred of evidence the evm\s are being attacked the post read.mr jaitley also cited a recent event held in london to make his point. the campaign became farcical when a fraudulent press conference was held by an invisible man through video in london claiming to have knowledge of the alleged 2014 rigging he said.emphasising that the government is the principal manager of the nation\s economy mr jaitley said the government legitimately flags the issues relating to liquidity and credit availability with the rbi. how can raising legitimate issues relating to credit and liquidity availability be an interference with the rbiin december then rbi governor urjit patel had resigned citing personal reasons. the government had appointed former bureaucrat shaktikanta das as his successor the next day.moving on to another topic the minister defendedthe centre\s decision to refer back one of the recommendations of the supreme court collegium for judicial appointments saying that the constitution allows the government to do so. regarding delay in implementing the recommendations the last five years have seen more appointments each year than done in any of the upa years he added.he also claimed that the ill advised press conference by four judges of the top court in january 2018 was the result of intra court disputes rather than government interference.he also also accused the congress of aligning with maoists in the chhattisgarh elections and backing urban naxals in courts.131 commentsrahul gandhi stood shoulder to shoulder with the \tukde tukde\ gang at the jawaharlal nehru university. and yet it claims to be friend of both the idea of india and its institutions.

new delhia number of opposition leaders on monday attended andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu\s day long fast and slammed prime minister narendra modi and his party over a host of issues. however what might pinch the most is sanjay raut\s surprise appearance at the congregation of opposition parties. the leader attended the event as a representative of the shiv sena amid strains with ally bjp. the bonhomie between the tdp chief and the bjp\s ally was made evident when mr naidu called sena chief uddhav thackeray his best friend.uddhav thackeray is the best friend of mine. even bal thackeray was very affectionate towards me. i really appreciate shiv sena chief for extending the cooperation mr naidu was quoted by news agency ani.mr naidu followed the praise with an attack on prime minister narendra modi. narendra modi is a vindictive leader with whom even shiv sena is not happy he added.the andhra chief minister\s one day fast to demand special status to his state was attended by opposition leaders like national conference chairperson farooq abdullah ncp\s majeed memon dmk\s tiruchi siva and loktantrik janata dal\s sharad yadav. congress leaders digvijaya singh and kamal nath were also in attendance.i took the principal stand to protect democracy to save the democracy. if there is no democracy neither i nor sanjay raut or digvijay singh would be able to talk anything which is very dangerous for the nation mr naidu added.the bjp and the shiv sena are allies in maharashtra and at the centre. however the two parties have maintained an acrimonious equation over the years. with lok sabha elections round the corner the bjp is trying to woo the party. the uddhav thackeray led party is however playing hardball saying it would go solo in the upcoming elections.the sena has been attacking the government over a host of issues. last year the party had backed the opposition\s demand of a jpc probe in the rafale jet deal. the most poignant attack came from mr thackeray when he repeated the congress slogan at a rally. chowkidaar chor hai\ he said at a rally in maharashtra\s pandharpur last year.earlier this month election strategist and bjp ally prashant kishor met sena chief uddhav thackeray and his son aditya thackeray. their discussions over lunch   photos of which were tweeted by thackeray junior    had caused much buzz in view of the coming elections.though sena leader sanjay raut had called it a courtesy visit the day after the visit there were newspaper reports that he had undertaken to have his team craft the campaign for the sena.mr kishor\s party had denied the reports.6 commentswith inputs from ani

new delhiprime minister narendra modi acted as anil ambani\s middleman rahul gandhi said today in his latest allegation linked to the rafale controversy citing an email that he said revealed that the industrialist had visited france and met with the french defence minister a fortnight before pm modi announced the 36 jet deal. the congress president alleged that anil ambani was aware of the deal when even the defence minister and foreign secretary didn\t know.pm has compromised national security he has done what spies do rahul gandhi said in a press conference.the congress president held up a copy of what he said was an email by an airbus employee with details of the meeting.anil ambani who met the french defence minister mentioned an mou he is looking forward to sign after the indian prime minister\s visit to france. mr ambani says he is first looking to make commercial helicopters. this is a breach of the official secrets act. the pm is the only other person who knows about this. in fact anil ambani opened his company after this meeting. the pm is acting as anil ambani\s middleman it is in black and white for anyone who reads the email said rahul gandhi.anil ambani visited then french defence minister jean yves le drian\s office in paris and had a meeting with his top advisers in march 2015.according to anil ambani\s reliance defence the visit had nothing to do with rafale they say he visited france to discuss a naval utility helicopter deal for which the government of india had issued a request for information in 2015.the email described the meeting as confidential and planned as you can imagine with very short notice.the airbus letter said anil ambani told them he intends to work with airbus helicopters on commercial helos and then on defence. he is also said to have mentioned a memorandum of understanding mou in preparation and the intention to sign during the pm visit.21 commentsdisclaimer ndtv has been sued for 10000 crores by anil ambani\s reliance group for its coverage of the rafale deal

new delhithe interim budget presented earlier this month by union minister piyush goyal was passed in the lok sabha today amid a walkout by the congress and the left parties. the budget that announced a massive direct cash transfer scheme worth rs. 75000 for farmers was criticised by the congress as having no real substance.among other announcements the government also gave 100 per cent rebate for small taxpayers whose yearly earnings are up to rs. 5 lakh.finance minister piyush goyal introduced the appropriation bill and the finance bill today amid protests by opposition members in the house by a voice vote.the bills were passed by voice vote after the finance minister\s reply.mr goyal said the government has worked for all sections of the society and has taken care of them in this budget.the poor farmers and the middle class are the government\s priorities. our government was the first to increase minimum support price msp for farmers mr goyal said as his speech was interrupted by slogans from the opposition benches.adchoicesadvertisinginread invented by teadscongress leader shashi tharoor said he was given only two minutes to speak.in the interim budget the cash transfer benefit for farmers drew the most criticism   the congress said rs. 6000 a year was a tiny amount and an insult to farmers. not much however has been said about the alterations in taxes for the salaried class which include a complete exemption for people who earn less than rs. 5 lakh a year.another big announcement in the interim budget was for a mega pension programme for informal sector workers with income below rs. 15000. the vast majority of the country\s workers are employed in small enterprises often with little job security and no social security benefits. this plan the government said will help them become financially stable.congress led upa committed a breach of trust with the people of india. they did nothing for the poor said mr goyal adding that there is no accounting jugglery in the budget for 2019 20 under the leadership of prime minister narendra modi. commentthe overall expenditures in the budget are at rs. 27.84 lakh crore 13 per cent larger than the last year\s figure. the expenditure for defence has been increased to rs. 3.05 lakh crore from rs. 2.85 lakh crore in 2018 19.

priyanka gandhi in lucknow a smiling priyanka gandhi vadra kicked off her lucknow roadshownew delhipriyanka gandhi vadra reached uttar pradesh capital lucknow this morning and kicked off a rally accompanied by her brother congress president rahul gandhi and senior party leader jyotiraditya scindia. priyanka gandhi vadra seen as the congress\ big hope for the 2019 lok sabha elections announced her entry into politics as the party\s general secretary in charge of eastern uttar pradesh two weeks ago. reviving congress fortunes in the eastern part of uttar pradesh will be a symbolic victory for the party as allahabad has been home to the nehru family and was also former prime minister lal bahadur sastri\s lok sabha seat. neighbouring phulpur used to be india\s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru\s lok sabha seat.the last two lok sabha elections in eastern uttar pradesh for the gorakhpur and phulpur constituencies were disastrous for the congress. congress candidates managed to fetch only around 19000 votes each and registered only a 2% vote share in each constituency.eastern uttar pradesh currently has strongholds of both uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath and prime minister narendra modi.a 30 kilometre long roadshow is planned in lucknow as a grand welcome for the top three congress leaders through some of the most congested areas of the city.priyanka gandhi vadra will in the course of the next three days conduct daily meetings over specific constituencies of the 40 odd lok sabha seats which fall under her purview. sources say instead of returning

puneminister of state for external affairs general vk singh wednesday raised questions over the capability and condition of hindustan aeronautics limited hal amid the congress\ claim that the modi government denied the defence psu an offset contract in the rafale deal.talking to reporters in pune the minister defended the rafale deal saying the purchase of 36 rafale fighter jets from france was necessary to enhance the indian air force\s capabilities.look at the condition of hal. our two pilots died. sorry to say but the programmes at hal are running late by three and a half years...parts of aircraft are falling off on the runway. is this capability on the other hand we say that hal is not getting the rafale work he said.the minister was referring to the death of two pilots in a crash of mirage 2000 trainer aircraft in bengaluru on february 1. the aircraft was on an acceptance sortie after an upgrade by the hal.on claims by the congress that the modi government had favoured industrialist anil ambani\s firm in the rafale deal the former army chief said in rafale case it is the french who decided the offset firm. the objective of the offset is to allow the industry to thrive here...if their firm is not satisfied with hal it is their decision...it is not the decision of the indian government.the opposition is trying to rake up the rafale issue as a counter to the bofors deal he said referring to the rs. 1437 crore deal between india and swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors in 1986 for supply of 400 units of 155 mm howitzer guns for the indian army.in the 60s we came up with an indigenous design of hindustan fighter 24   marut. but the gas turbine research establishment gtre which was assigned to develop an engine for the aircraft failed to do so and we had to look at importing the engine he said.in order to get the engine india approached the us who gave an oversparred engine leading to the death of many pilots he said.we had to scrap the programme. but later the french approached us and our government allowed them to have a look at a static aircraft. then they clicked several pictures of the aircraft and on that basis the series of mirage aircraft started he said.had the then government compelled the gtre to develop the engine the country would have got its own aircraft and with advancements in technology the country\s indigenous aircraft would have been better than rafale he said.if they are accusing the present government on the rafale deal then the blame for the failure of hf 24 should go to the then government and i would like to call it treason as the entire data of hf 24 was wiped off without anybody\s knowledge he said.matters related to national security should not be politicised the minister said adding that india requires these 36 rafale aircraft in the absence of which the capability of the indian air force will be hampered.it was necessary to purchase these 36 aircraft as the capabilities of the indian air force were depleting. if we keep pulling each other\s legs we will cause a major loss to the defence of the nation he said.on talks with pakistan the minister said when pm modi became the prime minister in 2014 india showed a positive gesture to improve relations with the neighbouring country through dialogue.our stand since 2014 was very clear as talks and terror activities cannot go hand in hand. even today we are firm on our stand he said.disclaimer ndtv has been sued for 10000 crores by anil ambani\s reliance group for its coverage of the rafale deal98 comments

chennai new delhithe bjp\s tie up with the aiadmk is nearly done say sources signaling a big about turn by tamil nadu\s ruling party which had just weeks ago talked about its cadre being strongly against such an alliance. bjp president amit shah will seal the alliance soon say sources adding that the deal may be done by the time prime minister narendra modi travels to kanyakumari to address a rally on february 19.last month aiadmk spokesperson c ponnaiyan had told ndtv that the cadre does not want any alliance with the bjp because they felt pm modi\s party didn\t do much for the state especially on the cauvery dispute with karnataka.to explain its change of heart the southern party refers to the pro poor announcements in the centre\s interim budget that it had first criticised. if they had been so serious they could have announced them in the last budget itself. now announcement of these programmes is only meant for elections. it shows it is their election manifesto and not the budget the party\s m thambidurai had said.the bjp looking to gain ground in the 39 seat state has for over a year been pursuing the aiadmk which is seen to be greatly weakened and riven by feuding after the death of its charismatic chief j jayalalithaa in 2016. its rival dmk has already announced that it will partner with the congress.a series of income tax and cbi raids on the state health minister chief secretary and the police chief meant that the aiadmk virtually surrendered itself to the bjp.in the past few months the aiadmk was seen to be changing its stand on any alliance with the bjp with mr thambidurai saying the bjp had not done anything for tamil nadu. we will align only with a party that is good for the state.in the 2014 national election the aiadmk won 37 seats in the state. the bjp snubbed by jayalalithaa formed an alliance with parties like mdmk pmk and dmdk but ended up with just two seats.this time the aiadmk is split in two with a rebel faction supporting jayalalithaa\s long time aide vk sasikala who made a failed bid to take over the party and chief ministership after her death before being jailed for corruption. sasikala\s nephew ttv dhinakaran has launched ammk and even won jayalalithaa\s rk nagar constituency in a by election.but then again last week the aiadmk hinted that a tie up with the bjp was definitely brewing. as deputy chief minister o panneerselvam spoke about talks with regional national and friendly parties another aiadmk leader d jayakumar said anything can happen in politics... he panneerselvam gave a veiled indication... only you have to understand.16 commentsthe aiadmk has reportedly deputed its ministers to hold talks with bjp leaders including amit shah and union ministers nitin gadkari and ravi shankar prasad. all three are expected to visit tamil nadu this week.

lucknowas priyanka gandhi vadra sets off with her mission uttar pradesh another woman politician in the state is watching her moves closely. aparna yadav the younger daughter in law of mulayam singh yadav and a samajwadi party candidate who lost against the bjp\s rita bahuguna joshi in the 2017 up election says had priyanka been projected as the chief ministerial face the samajwadi party congress alliance would have done much better.i really welcome this move of priyankaji she told ndtv on the younger gandhi sibling\s political debut as general secretary in charge of a part of up. she is a natural in politics and i remember that day when in a joint press conference they announced sheila dikshit as the chief ministerial face. if at that time they had announced priyanka gandhi it would have been a different story.aparna yadav 30 has kept many guessing about her own political choices too. the uk university educated wife of samajwadi party chief akhilesh yadav\s half brother prateek has been seen to be ranged against her brother in law.she supported akhilesh yadav\s uncle shivpal yadav who after a major falling out with the former up chief minister quit the samajwadi party. however she ruled out joining shivpal yadav\s new outfit the pragatisheel samajwadi party. we will give chachaji all the support that he needs. however in the 2019 elections my job is to look after netaji\s mulayam singh yadav\s mainpuri constituency and help him win.in the run up to the up election two years ago aparna yadav rattled her party with her praise for prime minister narendra modi\s style. after the bjp\s yogi adityanath took over as chief minister she met with the saffron robed monk politician and greeted him with flowers. heading into the national election due by may she has expressed support for the building of the ram temple in ayodhya which has been at the forefront of bjp\s poll narrative in recent months. this led many to ask if she was keen on joining the bjp. let\s see what happens\\ she told ndtv. asked about contesting the election as a samajwadi candidate she said  i have spoken to bhaiyya akhilesh and if they give me a good seat i would like to fight for that.aparna yadav claims that the samajwadi party\s grand alliance with mayawati\s bahujan samaj party bsp is facing some major challenges. mayawati ji and bhaiyya have told the workers but in most places they are not working together. because they have been always fighting against each other that seems to be continuing she said.this would not be fixed she asserted until the leadership acknowledged the problem. you can only deal with it if you say there is a problem which i don\t think is happening right now she said.sources told ndtv that more than the workers\ rivalry one key issue is that both mayawati and akhilesh yadav are yet to announce the seats they will contest. while seat sharing was apparently decided when they met in the first week of january mayawati reportedly doesn\t want to announce them just yet.4 commentsakhilesh yadav was reportedly ready to announce the seats any time after january 21. but samajwadi sources told ndtv that work had already begun in individual constituencies and the candidates for some have also been decided and they have been told to begin their campaign.

puneminister of state for external affairs general vk singh wednesday raised questions over the capability and condition of hindustan aeronautics limited hal amid the congress\ claim that the modi government denied the defence psu an offset contract in the rafale deal.talking to reporters in pune the minister defended the rafale deal saying the purchase of 36 rafale fighter jets from france was necessary to enhance the indian air force\s capabilities.look at the condition of hal. our two pilots died. sorry to say but the programmes at hal are running late by three and a half years...parts of aircraft are falling off on the runway. is this capability on the other hand we say that hal is not getting the rafale work he said.the minister was referring to the death of two pilots in a crash of mirage 2000 trainer aircraft in bengaluru on february 1. the aircraft was on an acceptance sortie after an upgrade by the hal.on claims by the congress that the modi government had favoured industrialist anil ambani\s firm in the rafale deal the former army chief said in rafale case it is the french who decided the offset firm. the objective of the offset is to allow the industry to thrive here...if their firm is not satisfied with hal it is their decision...it is not the decision of the indian government.the opposition is trying to rake up the rafale issue as a counter to the bofors deal he said referring to the rs 1437 crore deal between india and swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors in 1986 for supply of 400 units of 155 mm howitzer guns for the indian army.in the 60s we came up with an indigenous design of hindustan fighter 24   marut. but the gas turbine research establishment gtre which was assigned to develop an engine for the aircraft failed to do so and we had to look at importing the engine he said.in order to get the engine india approached the us who gave an oversparred engine leading to the death of many pilots he said.we had to scrap the programme. but later the french approached us and our government allowed them to have a look at a static aircraft. then they clicked several pictures of the aircraft and on that basis the series of mirage aircraft started he said.had the then government compelled the gtre to develop the engine the country would have got its own aircraft and with advancements in technology the country\s indigenous aircraft would have been better than rafale he said.if they are accusing the present government on the rafale deal then the blame for the failure of hf 24 should go to the then government and i would like to call it treason as the entire data of hf 24 was wiped off without anybody\s knowledge he said.matters related to national security should not be politicised the minister said adding that india requires these 36 rafale aircraft in the absence of which the capability of the indian air force will be hampered.it was necessary to purchase these 36 aircraft as the capabilities of the indian air force were depleting. if we keep pulling each other\s legs we will cause a major loss to the defence of the nation he said.on talks with pakistan the minister said when pm modi became the prime minister in 2014 india showed a positive gesture to improve relations with the neighbouring country through dialogue.our stand since 2014 was very clear as talks and terror activities cannot go hand in hand. even today we are firm on our stand he said.disclaimer ndtv has been sued for 10000 crores by anil ambani\s reliance group for its coverage of the rafale deal98 comments

jaipurthe congress government in rajasthan passed a bill earmarking 5 per cent reservation for gujjars in jobs and education today amid a huge protest by the community which has paralysed road and rail traffic since last week in parts of the state.the next step deputy chief minister sachin pilot said is to approach the central government for an amendment in the constitution which would make its implementation possible.rajasthan has already touched the 50 per cent ceiling on reservation placed by the supreme court.tamil nadu and maharashtra have crossed fifty per cent quota. also parliament has just given 10 per cent quota to the economically backward classes mr pilot pointed out.we will pass this bill and send it to the centre so they can pass it with a constitutional amendment like they have done in the 10 per cent quota case mr pilot told the state assembly. we will go meet bjp chief amit shah when he comes to jaipur to ask him to have this passed.last month the centre had passed the bill that provided for 10 per cent reservation in jobs and education for the economically weaker sections in the general category. the bill was introduced as a constitutional amendment which made the quota legally valid.the gujjar agitation flared up soon after with the community pointing out that the congress had promised five per cent reservation to them in its election manifesto.the gujjars who comprise around 5 per cent of rajasthan\s population and are traditional supporters of the bjp have been demanding quota since 2006. although covered under the quota for other backward classes they demanded an extra 5 per cent quota for the community.efforts have been made twice by bjp led governments in the state to grant that quota under various heads. but it has been repeatedly struck down by the rajasthan high court.the last such effort was made in 2017 when the vasundhara raje government gave gujjars 5 per cent reservation as a most backward class and expanded the obc quota to 26 per cent.we know that five per cent reservation has been overturned in the past. but now the circumstances are different said mr pilot. the centre has just crossed the 50 per cent limit. the path has been cleared.20 commentsthe congress has added a line to the rajasthan backward classes bill that says since the centre has given 10 per cent reservation to the ews sections in the general category the rajasthan government proposes 5 per cent quota for the most backward castes which would include gujjars and four other nomadic tribes.

patnaformer bihar congress president ram jatan sinha on tuesday joined the ruling janata dal united and lavished praise on chief minister nitish kumar who heads the party.after joining the jdu at an auditorium in presence of top leaders like national vice president prashant kishor and state unit chief vashishth narayan singh mr sinha was felicitated at the party office by mr kumar.mr sinha is not an ordinary leader and his joining our party will have immense consequences mr kumar told reporters on the occasion.today we see doors of political parties are closed on talented young people which is regrettable. our party however is different as it is not controlled by a family.and therefore there is hardly any social segment which is not duly represented in the jdu the chief minister said.earlier at the party function in bapu sabhagar auditorium mr sinha had said nitish kumar is a leader who thinks of bihars development all the time. and the state has prospered under his leadership since he has eradicated social strife along the lines of caste and religion.a known baiter of lalu prasad mr sinha also took potshots at the rjd supremos heir apparent tejashwi yadav whom he did not mention by name but remarked people without any formal education worth the name have the temerity to raise questions on the state of universities in bihar.mr sinha had severed his ties with the congress ahead of the 2015 assembly polls which he unsuccessfully contested as an independent candidate.a three time mla from makhdumpur assembly segment in jehanabad district now a reserved constituency mr sinha had served as the bpcc president in 2003.speculations are rife that he may be fielded by the jdu from jehanabad lok sabha segment which has a sizeable population of bhumihar community to which mr sinha belongs.mr sinha is the second former state unit chief of the congress to have joined the jdu in a year. in february last year three congress mlcs including former bpcc president ashok choudhary had crossed over to nitish kumars party.besides another former state congress president mehboob ali kaiser is with ram vilas paswans lok janshakti party a partner in the states ruling alliance. commenthowever tariq anwar who had served as a bpcc president in the 1980s but went on to co found the ncp along with sharad pawar returned to the party last year.
mumbaisenior nationalist congress party ncp leader ajit pawar on tuesday called for including the raj thackeray led maharashtra navnirman sena mns in any opposition alliance of secular forces in the 2019 lok sabha election.emphasising that it was his personal view he said that including the mns was imperative to prevent a split in the opposition votes and to ensure the defeat of the bharatiya janata party shiv sena combine in the state.speaking to the media he pointed out that in the 2014 election the mns got over 100000 votes although it contested a few lok sabha seats independently.a former deputy chief minister ajit pawar is the nephew of ncp president sharad pawar who enjoys a personal rapport with mns chief raj thackeray.ajit pawar\s statement is significant since all opposition political parties have spurned overtures by the mns to join their alliance especially the congress ncp combine.their distrust stems from the 13 year old party\s violent agitations launched in 2008 and 2010 against the north indian communities followed by raj thackeray\s visit to gujarat in 2013 and then his support to the bjp and its prime ministerial candidate narendra modi in 2014.the congress ncp samajwadi party bahujan samaj party and others are apprehensive that an alliance with the mns could seriously undermine their own support bases and benefit the bjp and sena.countering this mr pawar said there were many such instances in the past when alliances changed along with political situations as there were no permanent friends or enemies in politics.he cited the examples of west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee and andhra pradesh chief minister n. chandrababu naidu who were earlier with the bjp led nda and many others who later parted company and were now the strongest critics of the ruling dispensation.even raj thackeray is now speaking a different language and is highly critical of prime minister modi mr pawar said.on his part raj thackeray has made serious attempts to dilute his anti north indian image and on december 2 last year attended a massive gathering of the uttar bhartiya mahapanchayat sangh.6 commentshe also took the opportunity of his son\s wedding last month to invite the leaders of all major political parties including the congress ncp besides union ministers and shiv sena leaders.

gandhinagarnearly 50 per cent of the country is currently facing drought with at least 16 per cent falling in the exceptional or extreme category according to iit gandhinagar scientists managing india\s real time drought prediction system.this ongoing drought will pose a lot of challenges in water availability this summer vimal mishra associate professor at the indian institute of technology iit gandhinagar told pti.the real time monitoring system run by his team which includes phd student amardeep tiwari collects weather and precipitation data from the india meteorological department imd which is then used to simulate soil moisture and other factors that contribute to drought.the results of the simulations prepared by the water and climate lab at iit gandhinagar are available on the website of the india meteorological department imd.about 47 per cent of the country is facing drought    with 16 per cent facing extreme or exceptional category of drought    which we show from our real time monitoring system that we have developed for the country said mr mishra who heads the lab.arunachal pradesh did not get good rain this year and parts of jharkhand southern andhra pradesh gujarat and northern part of tamil nadu are under drought mr mishra said.if these areas experience very hot summer before the onset of monsoon it could lead to a crisis he warned.according to him continuing drought will further burden the already depleting ground water resources of the country.we are not enhancing groundwater recharge. on the other hand drought conditions are making us extract more and more water he said.while famine like conditions are not expected the drought will have a massive impact on the economy.it can create long term stress if not mortality for poor marginalised farmers mr mishra said.the scientist said global warming and climate change are likely to exacerbate drought in the coming years.if our groundwater is not recharged and managed sustainably we could face a very difficult situation in the coming years mr mishra said adding that groundwater is being used irresponsibly at present.you can reduce groundwater by selecting appropriate crops. if we already have depleted groundwater we should not grow water intensive crops. for example punjab should not be growing rice mr mishra said.the government needs to take some tough decisions as far as ground water and water conservation is concerned mr mishra said.conserving water in urban homes is just a drop in the bucket compared to steps that can be taken in the agriculture sector he said.of course conservation should be encouraged at every level but the elephant in the room is agriculture. eighty per cent of our total fresh water is used in agriculture sites rather than residential sites he said.he also stressed the need to equip ourselves better to tackle a drought situation. commentthe government thinks drought is a reactive situation that they will provide a relief only once there is a crisis... but with the data available they can take proactive measures to prevent a water crisis mr mishra said.

new delhithe delhi high court thursday dismissed a plea by congress lawmaker jairam ramesh challenging the amendments made to the anti money laundering law since 2015.a bench of chief justice rajendra menon and justice v k rao rejected the plea in which ramesh said that the amendments were done in violation of the constitution as they were enacted as money bills.the court had on wednesday reserved its order after hearing arguments on behalf of the congress leader and the centre.it had said that it would consider the petition.in the petition the rajya sabha mp has said that prior to the present regime at the centre such amendments were part of an ordinary bill.a money bill is a piece of legislation which can be introduced only in the lok sabha and the rajya sabha cannot amend or reject it. the upper house can only make recommendations which may or may not be accepted by the lower house.senior advocate p chidambaram and advocate abhishek jebraj appearing for the congress leader had told the court that the amendments made to the prevention of money laundering act pmla were unconstitutional and illegal as they have no relation to the money bill provisions enumerated in article 110 of the constitution.passing the impugned amendments by way of a money bill is grossly illegal and is expressly ultra vires the constitution of india. such action bypasses the authority of the upper house and is a desecration of bicameralism which forms an invaluable part of the basic structure of the constitution the petition has said.additional solicitor general asg maninder acharya and central government\s standing counsel amit mahajan had questioned the locus of ramesh to challenge the amendments and asked whether he has moved the petition on account of persons who have been accused of money laundering.they had said mr ramesh was in no way affected by the amendments to the pmla and a person affected ought to have moved the court. commentthe government lawyers had also said that there was no public interest in the matter.
hyderabadif things go as planned by the telangana unit of the congress it could well be former cricketer mohammad azharuddin versus aimim president asaduddin owaisi for the hyderabad lok sabha seat.the former india captain is the top pick of the telangana pradesh congress committee tpcc for the constituency. the party has shortlisted candidates for all the 17 lok sabha segments in telangana party sources said.the 56 year old cricketer turned politician who is from the city was appointed one of the working presidents of the tpcc before the december 7 2018 assembly elections in the state.there were earlier reports that mohammad azharuddin was keen to contest from secunderabad   now held by senior bjp leader and former union minister bandaru dattatreya   in the lok sabha election due by may.but it now looks unlikely that he would get the party nod to fight from there.however it\s not immediately clear if azharuddin is willing to throw his hat in the ring in hyderabad constituency an aimim stronghold represented by mr owaisi for three terms now.if the party high command asks him to contest from hyderabad he will do so a senior tpcc leader told pti when asked if mr azharuddin was indeed in the race.the ruling telangana rashtra samithi trs has already made it clear that it would support mr owaisi in hyderabad and expects his backing for its candidates in the remaining 16 segments.in the 2009 lok sabha poll mr azharuddin won from moradabad in uttar pradesh but in 2014 lost from tonk madhopur in rajasthan.in the 2014 lok sabha elections the ruling trs won 11 seats the congress two and the bjp aimim tdp and ysrcp one each in telangana.in the assembly elections held nearly three months ago the congress had forged an electoral alliance    prajakutami people\s front    with the telugu desam party tdp the communist party of india cpi and the telangana jana samiti tjs.but the grouping did not result in success.the congress won a mere 19 seats and the tdp could get only two while the cpi and tjs drew a blank. the trs was swept back to power securing 88 seats in the 119 member house.the alliance landscape may look different for the coming lok sabha elections in telangana.the congress has decided to contest all the 17 seats and has reached out to the cpi tjs and tdp requesting them to extend support to its candidates.but there are indications that cpi and cpi m may join hands and field their candidates.a senior tjs leader said a general feeling in the party is that we tjs should contest at least two or three seats. if as a party if we don\t contest we can\t survive. commenta top congress leader said his party was looking forward for indirect support from the tdp led by andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu.

new delhibjp president amit shah today hit out at opposition parties alleging they raised doubts on the courage of the armed forces and their demand for proof of the iaf air strike brought a smile on pakistan\s face.the party president said these parties should keep quiet if they were unable to appreciate what prime minister narendra modi and the country\s armed forces had achieved through the air strike on a jaish e mohammed terror camp in pakistan\s balakot.praising the pm\s leadership mr shah claimed pm modi went about his work routinely even as he thought up a plan to punish the perpetrators of the pulwama attack on february 14 which killed 40 crpf personnel.he claimed pm modi made the country understand what zero tolerance for terror meant by ordering the surgical strike and air strike.opposition leaders do not know what happened. mamata di asks for proof. rahul baba says it is being politicised. akhilesh asks for a probe. be ashamed that your statements have brought a smile on pakistan\s face mr shah said.pakistan smiled only after the press conferences of the opposition leaders where they raised questions on the courage of the armed forces he claimed.we can understand that you do not have the courage of modi ji but if you cannot support and praise what modi ji and the armed forces did then at least keep quiet mr shah added.after the pulwama attack people said surgical strike was not possible as army could not go to bust terror camps. modiji while going about his routine work quietly decided and planned the counterattack and our brave air force jawans killed hundreds of terrorists in an air strike and came back safely he said.he said with these strikes on terror camps india has become only the third country in the world after the us and israel to avenge attacks on its armed forces personnel.2 commentsnow the world accepts that india cannot be taken lightly. the entire world accepts that one cannot tamper with india\s borders. the entire world now accepts that it is not easy to touch indian soldiers. they will get the response for a bullet with cannon he said.

ahmedabadthe gujarat congress will not project any one leader as the party\s future face as it does not believe in running the show with one or two leaders like the bjp state party in charge rajiv satav has said.but he did not rule out fielding young leaders who emerged in the last few years like patidar quota agitation spearhead hardik patel in the upcoming lok sabha polls.the party is ready to take on the bjp in gujarat mr satav told pti in an interview adding that selection of candidates is underway and an announcement will be made soon.our policy is not to project one leader and go with him. we believe in taking everybody together he said when asked if the congress plans to make a leader like 25 year old hardik patel the party\s future face.he said like the 2017 gujarat assembly election the congress will give a big surprise to the bjp in the home state of prime minister narendra modi in the lok sabha poll.while the congress failed to win any lok sabha seat in 2014 it bagged 77 out of the total 182 assembly seats in the 2017 state polls considerably improving its performance but missing the victory target by 15 seats.mr satav the lok sabha member from maharashtra said congress chief rahul gandhi believes in giving chance to young leaders. he has given opportunity to many young leaders like priyanka gandhi and jyotiraditya scindia. but there are senior leaders whose experience and leadership matters.if you see the bjp it is a party of two leaders. the chief minister here in gujarat has no say while the deputy chief minister is nowhere to be seen he claimed.since 1995 the congress fared badly in election after election in gujarat which was once its stronghold. but after 2015 leaders like hardik patel jignesh mevani and alpesh thakor emerged in the state.alpesh thakor earlier joined the congress. jignesh mevani is an independent mla from vadgam with congress\ support while hardik patel is yet to take a decision on joining the party.asked if the congress was willing to give a chance to these leaders in the lok sabha polls mr satav said we will take along all those who believe in our ideology.he said the congress was gearing up to give a tough fight to the bjp in all 26 lok sabha seats in the state.before 2017 assembly polls nobody believed we could make huge gains in gujarat. we almost doubled our seats in the last state polls. this time the lok sabha poll results will also be different he said.he said rahul gandhi will pursue an extensive campaign like the way he did before the last assembly polls and is likely to address more than six rallies in the state.the 2017 gujarat polls broke the perception that the bjp can\t be defeated. though the congress fell short of a majority people of the state gave ample love to rahul gandhi as we were able to increase our tally from 43 to 77 he said.after the 2017 gujarat polls we defeated the bjp in every state poll we fought. it started from here he claimed.on charge that the congress was creating caste and class divide for poll gains he said when the bjp is losing and we are gaining they will make such baseless allegations.1 commentmodi made big promises but failed to deliver. when he became the prime minister it was expected the state will have rapid development but nothing happened. bringing international leaders on the sabarmati river banks will not yield anything mr satav quipped.

kolkataamid factionalism and hurdles in its mass outreach programme the west bengal unit of the bjp which has set a target of winning over 23 of 42 lok sabha seats in the state is carrying out a survey to assess the winnability of its candidates.with more than 60 70 aspirants throwing their hats into the ring for one seat especially in the northern and southern part of the state the party is grappling with internal dissent over ticket distribution.several factions including the ones led by leaders who switched to the bjp from the tmc are staking claims to the same seat forcing the state unit to seek an assessment of its candidates to meet its 23 seat target set by the party\s national president amit shah.it is unprecedented that we have been receiving such a huge number of applications for some seats. ten years back we used to have a tough time convincing people to contest on our ticket a bjp state unit leader said adding that a section of leaders has appealed to the central leadership to ensure that old timers don\t feel sidelined.the state unit in consultation with the central leaders has roped in an external agency to assess its prospects in the lok sabha constituencies he said.bjp national general secretary kailash vijayvargiya told pti that a candidate list will be prepared based on inputs by the external agency and the party\s senior leaders.we have launched both external and internal surveys to assess the winnability of seats and candidates. the survey will cover aspects such as a candidate\s potential in winning a seat and his popularity. based on inputs from the internal survey and the external agency we will prepare our list he said.asked about internal dissent mr vijayvargiya said the bjp is a disciplined party and once the names of candidates are announced every member will work to ensure their victory in the elections.according to sources within the party the state unit will send names of at least three candidates for every lok sabha seat to the central unit which would then take a final call on the matter.bjp state president dilip ghosh claimed that the party is putting in equal efforts in all constituencies notwithstanding its target of winning at least 23 seats.our party president had given us a target of 23 seats but if the elections are held in a fair manner we are in a position to win at least 26 seats mr ghosh told pti.the state unit has already categorized the seats as \a plus\ \a\ \b\and \c\ as per their prospects according to another senior leader of the party.the classification of the constituencies into four categories was done on the basis of five criteria   bjp\s organisational strength the demographic situation number of muslims hindu and hindu refugee population its organisational weakness the geographical location and the potential of the candidate he said.the party has kept darjeeling and asansol seats out of the survey\s purview as it is confident of retaining them.of the 42 lok sabha seats in the state the trinamool congress bagged 34 seats in 2014 the congress secured four seats while cpim and the bjp won two seats each.we have identified 18 20 seats in north and south bengal where our chances of winning is as high as 70 80%. this study was done keeping in mind our performance in those seats in the last few elections the bjp leader added.however despite all its efforts the bjp is still scouting for answers over its inability to constitute booth committees at all polling stations in the state.mr shah during its visit to bengal in september 2017 had sought booth committee formation at 77000 polling stations in the state but the party has been able to achieve only 75 percent of the target so far.1 commentwe have not been able to reach out to all the booths especially the ones in minority dominated areas. we have a support base but no one is ready to man the booth committees fearing backlash by the trinamool congress. we hope things will change in the days to come mr ghosh said.
chennaisenior congress leader p chidambaram saturday praised the bjp led centre for making a determined effort to clean up river ganga about which he felt proud.mr chidambaram also credited the nda government for succeeding in its national highway building programme and further building on the initiatives of the upa regime like the aadhaar.every government took some initiatives which are good and beneficial he said adding i mean even the most incompetent government will do a few things which are good for the country. how can you deny that any government will do some good things.answering a question from the audience at his undaunted saving the idea of india book release event in chennai he said he was very angry with the bjp led government because they did the largest evil to the largest number of people by demonetisation.also through the flawed implementation of the gst he alleged the largest evil was done to business and trade.on the positive side he said i think the national highway programme has been a success they are building more kilometers per day than we did i think the next government will build more as the system is in place.the national highway programme was indeed a good programme he said addingwe must give credit to them for the nh initiative.the second positive aspect he found was that the nda built on initiatives of the upa regime like the zero balance no frills bank accounts by calling it the jan dhan plan.jan dhan is good. i compliment them. we started it we opened 34 crore accounts and they have opened another 35 crore accounts which is good.likewise the upa regime launched the aadhaar initiative and though bjp claimed that it would be scrapped they did not mercifully do that he said.the nda government further built on it and facilitated cash transfer of subsidy for lpg through aadhaar he said.referring to the river ganga clean up initiative by the centre he said though it has not borne results but at least they are making a determined effort to clean the ganga. i think five times we have tried to clean the ganga we have failed...i hope this time we won\t fail...they are making a determined effort to clean the ganga which i am quite proud about.however barring such things there are huge monstrous failures of the nda government on the other side he said.to a hypothetical question on what position he would assume if the modi led government were to offer him one if the bjp retained power at the centre he said i would like to be the leader of the opposition.earlier during the panel discussion he advocated devolving more powers to the states and added that puducherry in my view this is congress party\s view is eminently ready to be a full state.delhi being the national capital region the police department should necessarily be with the centre and the state should be given other powers.on coalition governments at the centre he said the governments led by leaders including manmohan singh and atal bihari vajpayee delivered adding it is a distortion of history to say that only majority governments have .5 commentscoalitions stood a better chance of delivering in view of the checks and balances and demonetisation could have never happened in such a set up he said.

new delhiaccusing the congress led upa of running a terrible government and even a more terrible opposition finance minister arun jaitley sunday said their statements have hurt india\s national interest and gave handle to pakistan to discredit the country.within days of india\s air strike at balakot the 21 opposition parties led by the congress passed a resolution accusing prime minister narendra modi of politicising the pulwama and balakot incidents.statements made by opposition parties after iaf\s counter terror operation in balakot hurt india\s national interest. they give smiles to pakistan and become an instrument in pakistan\s hands to discredit india\s operation against terrorism mr jaitley said in a blog stressing that on such occasions the nation ought to speak in one voice as was done by atal bihari vajpayee and jan sangh during the 1971 war.terming the resolution passed by 21 opposition parties as inappropriate he said it gave a handle to the enemy and pakistan\s media used the statement as a trump card.the government had twice taken the leaders of opposition parties into confidence he said.referring to the statement of former prime minister manmohan singh the finance minister said that he sought to elevate himself to the status of a neutral third party while raising doubts about india\s right to defend its sovereignty from those who want to damage it through terrorism.i was most disappointed with a brief but a highly objectionable statement of the former prime minister dr manmohan singh mr jaitley said.while receiving the pv narasimha rao award for the lifetime achievement dr singh had stated that he was disturbed with the mad rush of mutual self destruction by the two nations. dr singh further went on to argue that poverty ignorance and disease were the real problems in the two countries and that saner counsel on both sides needed to think on the issue.mr jaitley wondered that there was no condemnation of terrorism in that speech of the former prime minister.implicitly he doubts india\s right to defend its sovereignty from those who want to damage it through terrorism he said.mr jaitley further said the congress led upa government from 2004 to 2014 ran a terrible government. from 2014 to 2019 it was even a more terrible opposition.pointing that west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee went a step further he said she started doubting the veracity of the incident and wanted to know the operational details.the credibility of both the government and our air force is being doubted. even congress leaders have raised similar questions he said in a facebook post titled india\s opposition has a lot to learn.mr jaitley emphasised that the opposition is entitled to oppose and ask questions but then restrain and statesmanship are also essential ingredients of public discourse.he expressed hope that india\s opposition revisits its position and does not let down the nation.mr jaitley also pointed that the retaliatory attack by pakistan\s f 16 was the most botched up operation and the neighbouring country was globally isolated.not only was pakistan globally isolated the issue of its terrorism has reached the security council. so helpless was the situation that it was in no position to even admit the attack at balakot. if it had admitted the attack and its consequences the evidence of a terrorist camp in existence and the list of dead terrorists would have been international issue he said.reacting to mr jaitley\s post congress spokesperson randeep singh surjewala in a tweet said \blog minister\ continues his antics as a self styled \caricaturist\ to stay relevant by attacking dr. manmohan singh. commentatleast 5 surgical strikes took place under dr. singh\s charge but he didn\t make bravery of jawans a political pamphlet for votes.

on institutional credibility make this a make or break for our idea of an inclusive progressive developing bharat he said.asked about the narrative of modi versus the rest and the bjp\\s mahamilavat highly adulterated barb at opposition alliances the rld leader said the fact is that the diversity of india can have true political representation only through alliances.the bjp also ran a government in alliance with many parties and will have tie ups in many states including up he said.slamming the bjp for the pm modi versus the rest narrative and the mahamilavat jibe mr chaudhary said leaders don\t walk alone they build a team of capable leaders and this has been modi\s big failure in government.we know that he likes to work alone and walk alone but india needs a leadership that listens to feedback collaborates with others and respects diversity he said.hitting out at the use of the term mahamilavat by pm modi and the bjp he said it betrays a negative mindset.the notion of purity was the basic foundation of caste oppression in india. to imply that the opposition is impure to me this slogan uses the language and symbolism that divided our country into castes and that is why i strongly object to it he said.asked whether national security and the post pulwama airstrikes will be the major issues in up or the alleged agrarian distress mr chaudhary said it is the jawan and kisan who have borne the brunt of the myopic and adhoc policies the incumbent government has unleashed over last five years.therefore both will feature prominently. note ban had a debilitating impact on rural livelihoods and economic activities in our hinterland. farmers have faced rising input costs depressed produce prices and diminishing returns he alleged.rural labourers and artisans as well as dairy farmers have also suffered. they are not willing to listen to a government that gives paltry sums on the cusp of elections and trumpets empty failing schemes like the kisan bima yojana and the soil health card he claimed.national security has been a major failing of this government. we have been subjected to more attacks lost more jawans than before and it still appears we have no comprehensive policy on pakistan. our responses should always be measured and fit with our larger long term geopolitical and security strategy he said.instead there has been only a reactive policy from this government the rld leader alleged.the \\shaheed\\ status demand orop and issues highlighted by para  and retired forces\\ welfare associations will be addressed by us if given a chance he asserted.on priyanka gandhi vadra\s entry into active politics and the impact of her campaigning the rld leader said he was not privy to what has been planned in terms of the congress campaign and cannot comment on the impact.1 commentbut i think there is a positive energy that people attribute to priyanka ji so it\s good that she has decided to take the plunge. look forward to her intervening especially on issues relating to gender equity and women\s welfare which i believe are underrepresented in the mainstream politics he said.

kolkataamid the ongoing seat sharing talks between the cpim and the congress in west bengal the left front on friday announced its candidates for the raiganj and murshidabad lok sabha seats a bone of contention between the two parties.the announcement drew sharp reactions from the congress which was not ready to compromise on those two seats that if needed the party will fight alone in all the 42 lok sabha seats but will not compromise with its dignity.the announcement of candidates in these two seats held by the cpim might lead to a breakdown in the seat sharing discussions between the two parties and eventually pave the way for a four cornered contest in the state in the upcoming general election.besides the cpim and the congress the ruling trinamool congress tmc and a resurgent bharatiya janata party bjp are vying for a large number of seats in the politically important state in the upcoming polls.the current mps    mohammed salim and badaruddoza khan    would contest from raiganj and murshidabad respectively biman bose chairman of the cpim led left front said.the west bengal congress in a press statement said it was unfortunate that the left front had announced the two candidates while the discussion over seat adjustment was on.our national leadership has been in touch with their left front national leadership. it was decided by the leaders of both the parties to convey the resolution of friday\s left front meeting to our central leadership. but they have announced the candidates unilaterally. we are sending a report to our national leadership about the development as the aicc is monitoring the matter right now the statement said.mohammed salim and badaruddoza khan had won these two seats the last time. we have decided not to field candidates in the four lok sabha seats won by the congress the last time.we want to ensure the maximum polling of anti bjp and anti tmc votes and that is why we have decided not to contest the four lok sabha seats won by the congress the last time mr bose said.asked whether the left front would stick to its stand if the congress did not respect its no mutual contest proposal he said if they took a different stand then the left leaders would discuss the matter and take a call.reacting to the development a senior state congress leader who was privy to the talks told pti if the cpim thinks it can use these pressure tactics against us it is wrong. if needed we will fight alone. we have nothing to lose. we too want the maximum polling of anti bjp and anti tmc votes but not at the cost of our dignity.we still have 10 11 per cent votes in bengal the left should not forget that he said.the development came at a time when congress president rahul gandhi had asked the congress in charge of west bengal gaurav gogoi to speak to cpim general secretary sitaram yechury in order to resolve the impasse over seat sharing between the two parties in the state.mr gandhi had also met west bengal congress chief somen mitra to discuss the matter. the state congress had requested gandhi to take a call on the matter.the cpim central committee on monday came out with a proposal of no mutual contest in the lok sabha polls in the six seats jointly held by the two parties in the state.it was seen as a move to untangle the seat sharing formula between the two parties to consolidate the anti bjp and anti tmc votes.while the congress had bagged four seats in the state in the 2014 general election the left party had won only raiganj and murshidabad. both seats are known as congress bastions.while north dinajpur\s raiganj has been a pocket borough of congress stalwart priya ranjan dasmunsi murshidabad\s politics has been dominated by the party\s firebrand leader adhir chowdhury who is also a vociferous supporter of the alliance with the left.1 commentthe two seats have been a bone of contention between the two sides since the beginning of the discussions.

new delhithe anti thesis of gandhian thought is congress culture prime minister narendra modi wrote today in a blog on the anniversary of mahatma gandhi\s 1930 dandi march targeting the opposition party and the gandhi family on a day the congress working committee meets for a strategy session in his home state gujarat.pm modi began with an ode to the great sardar patel who he said had a key role in planning every minute aspect of the dandi march down to the last detail. the congress accuses the bjp of trying to appropriate sardar vallabhbhai patel one of its most iconic leaders and india\s first home minister.in many of his works gandhi ji said that he does not believe in inequality and caste divisions. sadly the congress has never hesitated from dividing society. the worst caste riots and anti dalit massacres happened under congress rule pm modi wrote in the blog listing a point by point contrast of gandhi\s thoughts and congress culture.gandhi said the prime minister had understood the congress culture very well which is why he wanted the congress disbanded especially after 1947.quoting gandhi as saying that misgovernance and corruption always go together pm modi said while his government had done everything to punish the corrupt ...the nation has seen how congress and corruption have become synonyms. name the sector and there will be a congress scam  from defence telecom irrigation sporting events to agriculture rural development and more.he accused congress leaders of filling their own bank accounts and lead luxurious lifestyles at the cost of providing basic necessities to the poor.–– advertisement ––pm modi also accused the congress of going the dynasty first way even though mahatma gandhi despised dynastic politics.referring to the emergency of 1975 imposed by the indira gandhi led congress government pm modi wrote a firm believer in democracy bapu said \i understand democracy as something that gives the weak the same chance as the strong.\ ironically the congress gave the nation the emergency when our democratic spirit was trampled over. the congress misused article 356 several times. if they did not like a leader that government was dismissed. always eager to promote dynastic culture congress has no regard for democratic values.he quoted gandhi as saying i am sorry to have to say that many congressmen have looked upon this item swaraj as a mere political necessity and not as something indispensable....i would go to the length of giving the whole congress a decent burial rather than put up with the corruption that is rampant. commenthe signed off with the comment that thankfully today the country has a government that is working on bapu\s path and a jan shakti that is fulfilling his dream of freeing india from the congress culture

new delhiprime minister narendra modi is likely to contest from varanasi in uttar pradesh the parliamentary seat he retained after winning two seats in the 2014 election.there has been speculation that in the april may national election the prime minister may opt for another temple town puri but top party sources say he is likely to stick with varanasi.pm modi had in an interview to news agency ani not confirmed or denied whether he would contest from the odisha constituency. media persons also should get some work he had said.the bjp parliamentary board is apparently strongly in favour of a pm modi encore in varanasi. it is not clear however whether he will contest from a second seat and whether that seat will be puri.in 2014 pm modi 68 contested from varanasi as well as vadodara in his home state gujarat. after winning both he decided to retain the holy city in uttar pradesh.in varanasi he won with a huge margin over his rivals arvind kejriwal and congress\s ajay rai.the puri speculation does confirm the bjp\s determination to improve its score in states like bengal odisha and its neighbour andhra pradesh.the bjp\s assessment is that having pm modi as a candidate shored up its tally in uttar pradesh where it won a staggering 71 of 80 seats in 2014. with recent disappointments in up by polls and other big northern states rajasthan and madhya pradesh   the party lost both to the congress   the bjp sees more potential in odisha bengal and other states in the region say sources.in both bengal and odisha the bjp came second in key polls.bjp spokesperson sambit patra is believed to have set his sights on puri. sources say he and many other spokespersons are keen on contesting the polls for a chance at graduating from tv studios to parliament.the bjp\s central election committee meeting this week may finalise candidates and seats. commentvaranasi will vote on may 19 in the last round of seven phase polls that start on april 11. the results will be declared on may 23.

londonfugitive diamond merchant nirav modi wanted in india on fraud and money laundering charges amounting to $2 billion spent holi behind bars in one of england\s most overcrowded jails on thursday a day after a uk judge rejected his bail application.the 48 year old was arrested by scotland yard on tuesday and presented before district judge marie mallon at westminster magistrates\ court in london on wednesday.the judge remanded him in custody till march 29 after which he was transferred to her majesty\s prison hmp wandsworth in south west london.while he would hope to be held in a separate cell the overcrowding pressures of the jail may mean him sharing a prison cell with any of its around 1430 male prisoners.nirav modi one of india\s richest men accustomed to the high life and celebrity circles around the world will be faced with some harsh conditions at the prison amid some dubious inmates.during the most recent inspection carried out in february march 2018 the victorian era jail was found by uk chief inspector of prisons peter clarke to be one of the most overcrowded in england and wales and filled with many men with drug or mental health problems receiving poor training and education.despite six self inflicted deaths since the last inspection it was concerning to find that not all staff were carrying anti ligature knives that no staff would enter a cell alone   even if a prisoner\s life was in danger   and that the response to cell call bells was totally inadequate he noted.prison cells designed for one prisoner are often occupied by two with poorly screened lavatories and inmates being allowed far too little time out of their cells his inspection had concluded.the living conditions will certainly be in stark contrast to the luxury apartment at centre point in the west end of london where nirav modi has been living over the past year as it was confirmed during court proceedings on wednesday.he has done everything he possibly can to be visible to demonstrate his keenness to fully cooperate with uk authorities george hepburne scott nirav modi\s barrister told the court in support of his bail application.among the details that emerged during the hearing it was claimed that nirav modi was in the uk lawfully having acquired a national insurance no.   offered only to legal residents to be able to live and work in the uk.he had reportedly also been paying his council tax which is a local tax paid by a uk resident to the local authority and also serves as an identity document for address proof. based on this he also received an offer from the uk electoral register to register to vote and had submitted one of three passports to the uk\s driving and vehicle licensing authority dvla to apply for a driver\s licence.however nirav modi\s defence team\s efforts to establish his credibility as a lawful uk resident who had no intention of jumping bail and fleeing were strongly objected to by the crown prosecution service cps arguing on behalf of the indian authorities.the judge in the end ruled in favour of the indian authorities concluding that the wanted diamantaire had substantial grounds to fail to surrender and remanded him in custody until his next hearing scheduled for march 29.9 commentsthe court was told that nirav modi is wanted by the indian authorities for his role as a partner in a number of entities namely diamonds r us stellar diamonds and solar exports involved in the laundering of money and the fraudulent issuing of letters of undertaking lous to punjab national bank pnb.get the latest election news live updates and election schedule for lok sabha elections 2019 on ndtv.com elections. like us on facebook or follow us on twitter and instagram for updates from each of the 543 parliamentary seats for the 2019 indian general elections.
new delhiprime minister narendra modi will contest from his sitting constituency varanasi in the lok sabha elections that begin next month the bjp announced today as it launched its first list of candidates for the national elections. unlike the last elections pm modi will not be contesting from a second seat this time.in 2014 pm modi contested from varanasi as well as vadodara in his home state gujarat. after winning both he decided to retain the holy city in uttar pradesh.in varanasi he won with a huge margin over his rivals arvind kejriwal and congress\s ajay rai.the bjp\s assessment is that having pm modi as a candidate shored up its tally in uttar pradesh where it won a staggering 71 of 80 seats in 2014.there had been speculation that the prime minister may opt for another temple town of puri but top party sources had dismissed the rumours and said he is likely to stick with varanasi.uttar pradesh is one of the most crucial states of the hindi heartland. with the samajwadi party and bahujan samaj party alliance in the state and the congress fielding their trump card priyanka gandhi vadra as a general secretary the state\s elections will be one to watch out for. the opposition congress has already captured the other major states of chhattisgarh rajasthan and madhya pradesh in the last concluded assembly elections.5 commentsvaranasi will vote on may 19 in the last round of seven phase polls that start on april 11. the results will be declared on may 23.get the latest election news live updates and election schedule for lok sabha elections 2019 on ndtv.com elections. like us on facebook or follow us on twitter and instagram for updates from each of the 543 parliamentary seats for the 2019 indian general elections.

patnabihar was conspicuously missing when the bjp announced its first list of candidates for next month\s national election on thursday after days of deliberation. the ruling party said its 17 candidates in bihar would be announced by its state leadership along with alliance partners.the move has raised curiosity given that the names of bjp\s candidates in bihar are more or less public.party leaders reveal that there\s a worry about over representation of upper castes in a state where caste is a pivotal theme in poll math.sources say the bjp wants to wait until its ally chief minister nitish kumar\s janata dal united finalises its candidates.according to a list that has been floating in the public domain but has neither been confirmed nor denied nine of the 17 candidates   the bjp\s share of the state\s 40 seats following its deal with allies   are from the upper castes which constitute 15 per cent of bihar\s population.among these nine candidates is union minister ravi shankar prasad who is set to fight against his party colleague turned rebel shatrughan sinha in the patna saheb constituency. ravi shankar prasad is from the kayastha community.the other candidates radha mohan singh rajkumar singh rajiv pratap rudy sushil singh and janardan singh sigriwal are all from rajput caste. union minister giriraj singh who is expected to move to the begusarai seat is from the bhumihar caste and there are two brahmins   ashwini choubey and gopalji thakur.more than 15 percent bjp candidates therefore are from the upper caste. in the remaining eight seats two candidates are from the economically backward class and five from the obc other backward class. one candidate chedi paswan is from the scheduled caste and will contest from the sasaram seat which is reserved.the bjp has apparently learnt its lesson from the 2015 assembly elections when its list was similarly over represented by upper castes. the party lost the election winning only 53 of the state\s 243 seats.the bjp leadership is hoping that it can get the caste algorithm right with the janata dal united list which it believes will have more candidates from the backward castes.the party has still not forgotten when nitish kumar then its rival and lalu yadav had released their entire list for the 2015 election putting the bjp led coalition on the back foot because their candidates were mostly from the backward caste. commentthe national election will be held from april 11 to may 19 in seven rounds. bihar will vote in seven phases april 11 april 18 april 23 april 29 may 6 may 12 and may 19. the results will be declared on may 23.get the latest election news live updates and election schedule for lok sabha elections 2019 on ndtv.com elections. like us on facebook or follow us on twitter and instagram for updates from each of the 543 parliamentary seats for the 2019 indian general elections.

aizawlmizoram is going to be a dry state once again from april 1 this year. the mizoram legislative assembly has passed the mizoram liquor prohibition bill 2019 which seeks to ban consumption manufacture and sale of liquor for general public.prohibition was one of the major poll promises of the mizo national front led government that came to power in the state replacing the congress as ruling party last year by winning 26 seats in the 40 member house.state excise and narcotics minister k beichhua tabled in the assembly on wednesday the bill which was passed unanimously.lifting the ban on liquor in mizoram has had a severe impact on the mizo society. it led to untimely death of people in road accidents and increase in alcohol intake among the youth said the minister while tabling the bill.legislator from the zoram people\s movement zpm vanlalthlana referred to the recent liquor ban in bihar and said the move had led to reduction in crime in that state. while crime against women was reduced to 13 per cent after the liquor ban in bihar incidents of rape declined too mr vanlalthlana said while supporting the bill.in the last year\s mizoram assembly polls while the mnf promised a total ban the congress opposed it. the bjp on the other hand was for partial ban with locally produced liquor to be allowed. the church bodies which play a major role in the elections in mizoram favoured a complete ban.mizoram was a dry state between 1997 and 2015 when the then congress government lifted the ban. following the lifting of ban liquor shops thrived in the christian majority state. the congress justified the move by stating that it generated revenue and reduced spurious liquor related deaths. commentsoon after coming to power the mnf government had extended the dry days. following the decision the government banned sale of alcohol in government owned shops and shut nine such shops.get the latest election news live updates and election schedule for lok sabha elections 2019 on ndtv.com elections. like us on facebook or follow us on twitter and instagram for updates from each of the 543 parliamentary seats for the 2019 indian general elections.

has only one seat in the state represented by jual oram in the sundargarh seat.the owner of a large conglomerate with interests in mining power and real estate jay panda had been a parliamentarian of the bjd since 2000 and had been among the party\s most prominent leaders from odisha. jay panda said he had taken the step after nine months of introspection and widespread consultations with colleagues and the public.assembly polls in the state will be held simultaneously with the lok sabha elections in four phases on april 11 18 23 and 29.the bjp had won only one of its 21 lok sabha seats in 2014 but is hopeful of putting up a much better show there after it emerged as the main challenger to the bjd in the local polls.                                        var url = https

sitting constituency varanasi in the lok sabha elections that begin next month the bjp announced today as it launched its first list of candidates for the national elections. unlike the last elections pm modi will not be contesting from a second seat this time.in 2014 pm modi contested from varanasi as well as vadodara in his home state gujarat. after winning both he decided to retain the holy city in uttar pradesh.in varanasi he won with a huge margin over his rivals arvind kejriwal and congress\s ajay rai.the bjp\s assessment is that having pm modi as a candidate shored up its tally in uttar pradesh where it won a staggering 71 of 80 seats in 2014.there had been speculation that the prime minister may opt for another temple town of puri but top party sources had dismissed the rumours and said he is likely to stick with varanasi.uttar pradesh is one of the most crucial states of the hindi heartland. with the samajwadi party and bahujan samaj party alliance in the state and the congress fielding their trump card priyanka gandhi vadra as a general secretary the state\s elections will be one to watch out for. the opposition congress has already captured the other major states of chhattisgarh rajasthan and madhya pradesh in the last concluded assembly elections.varanasi will vote on may 19 in the last round of seven phase polls that start on april 11. the results will be declared on may 23.                                        var url = https  www.ndtv.com india news 2019 lok sabha election campaign live updates bjp finalises candidates for 27 seats in bengal

lucknowhighlightsup has 19 per cent muslim population higher than national average congress as solo player in polls wont affect yadav vote 2014 data shows79 per cent of scheduled caste votes for bsp and samajwadi partywindow._pricee = window._pricee ||  _pricee.push{container  \_pcwgtmid\}the key factors of caste and religion are likely to have a multiplier effect in uttar pradesh with a divided opposition ranged against the ruling bjp indicates data from last elections. it is very likely that a split in these votes may play into the hands of the bjp.the opposition parties   mayawati\s bahujan samaj party akhilesh yadav\s samajwadi party and the congress   have brushed off any such possibility. but math based on last election\s figures indicate otherwise.census data from 2011 shows uttar pradesh has 19 per cent muslim population    way higher than the national average of 14 per cent. the percentage of scheduled castes    21 per cent    also stands higher than the national average of 17 per cent.but in a state like uttar pradesh which has the highest population in india these figures translate into a huge number of voters.data from the 2014 election and exit polls show that congress as a solo player in the electoral arena would not affect the yadav vote 80 per cent of which goes to mayawati\s bahujan samaj party and the samajwadi party of akhilesh yadav.this is because the congress gets only four per cent of the yadav vote way lower than the 16 per cent that the bjp draws.of the scheduled caste votes a mammoth 79 per cent is scooped up by the sp and the bsp. here too the congress lags behind with 3 per cent votes while the bjp gets a much larger 17 per cent chunk.leaders of mayawati and akhilesh yadav\s parties say they are certain the congress will not have any impact on their voter base. they are also positive that the congress will eat into the bjp\s upper caste vote bank    an assumption that appears very off track in view of 2014 data.numbers indicate that while the bjp gets 67 per cent of the state\s brahmin vote the congress claims only 12 per cent of the upper caste votes way below the sp bsp\s 21 per cent.when it comes to muslim votes there is an 80 20 division between the sp bsp and the congress. and it is this category that might favour the congress when the party competes separately.29 commentsvoters from some villages said there was a good chance that more muslims would vote for the congress    an outcome that would favour the bjp on a section of seats.get the latest election news live updates and election schedule for lok sabha elections 2019 on ndtv.com elections. like us on facebook or follow us on twitter and instagram for updates from each of the 543 parliamentary seats for the 2019 indian general elections.
