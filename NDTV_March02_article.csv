But, there is a big difference now - India will no longer be helpless in the wake of terror. From 2004 to 2014 there were several terror attacks. The nation expected perpetrators to be punished but nothing happened. 26/11 happened, India expected action against terrorists but nothing happened. Uri happened and you saw what our brave men did. Pulwama happened and you saw what our brave men did. I salute all those who are serving the nation. Their vigilance keeps our nation secure.There was a time when the news reports would read- Air Force wanted to do surgical strike after 26/11 but UPA blocked it. Today, we are in an era where the news reads- Armed forces have full freedom to do what they want. Influence of terrorists and terrorism has been curtailed and it is going to be curtailed even more. This is a New India. This is an India that will return the damage done by terrorists with interest. The events of the past few days have demonstrated yet again the strength of our armed forces. It has also brought our nation closer. The way the nation has supported our armed forces is extra-ordinary and I bow to every Indian for that.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-visit-kanyakumari-to-unveil-series-of-development-projects-2001131?q_id=9"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Mar 01, 201915:32 (IST)-->PM Modi says it\'s the NDA government that had the honour of creating a new department for fisheries.

It\'s surprising how come a private company has bagged the right to run the airport even when this particular company has no experience in running airports. In Kerala, two airports (Kochi and Kannur) are run by specially formed companies under the Kerala government and are doing well,"" he said.Mr Vijayan noted that for the airport, Kerala government had taken over 635 acres of land and handed it for free, while in 2005, another 23.57 acres was again given free for the airport. ""There is a clause in the agreement that, if in future, the airport is handed over to a private company, then the value of the land given for free for the airport by the state government should be converted into equity of the state government,"" he said in the letter.Mr Vijayan also pointed out that the KSIDC has already approached the Kerala High Court over the handing-over and it has ruled that any decision on finalizing the tender should take place after the court\'s ruling come.In the financial bid opened on Monday, Adani had quoted the highest rate for a passenger for the Thiruvananthapuram airport at Rs 168, against the KSIDC\'s Rs 135 and the GMR\'s Rs 63.1 COMMENTThe other airports that Adani haswon in the tender are Mangaluru, Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Jaipur.']"

"['Mumbai:Former Union minister Yashwant Sinha Wednesday lamented at the decimation of Constitutional institutions like the Supreme Court, national investigative agency CBI, RBI, and Election Commission among others under the Modi government.He was more critical of the way how Prime Minister Narendra Modi has used the occasion of the National War Memorial dedication earlier this week to drive political mileage and sought to credit his party for the memorial.Given this background Mr Sinha, who has filed a petition seeking a CBI probe into the controversial Rafale jet deal on which the main Opposition Congress has alleged massive corruption to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore and personally blamed PM Modi, also called upon the civil society to be more vigilant and responsive in taking on the current dispensation.On the unceremonious way the last CBI chief Alok Verma was shunted out by the Modi government, the former finance minister said, ""it is with a degree of sorrow I say that in this whole episode, I don\'\'t think the highest court of the land has covered itself with glory"".Addressing an Asia Society event late evening, he also called for more institutionalised mechanism to select the heads of constitutionally mandated national institutions.""There is no reason why we should not have a high power panel to select the Chief Election Commissioner and other members of the EC instead of leaving it to the executive of the day. Even judicial appointment should not be left entirely to just one institution. We should have an in dependent body to select the judges as well,"" he said.""Given the compromises which have crept in, we need to do it sooner than later. Otherwise, we will continue with the present situation and the things are not going to improve,"" Mr Sinha warned.Stating that there are various other issues on which the conventions of the Constitution, which have been established over the last seven decades, they have been violated with impunity by this government.Flaying PM Modi for the politicizing the National War Memorial at India Gate, he said, ""can you imagine the Prime Minister going to inaugurate the War Memorial and uses that occasion for petty politics? This has happened and how many of us are questioning this?""Speaking of domestic politics on foreign soils, he said, ""there was a very healthy rule that we will not talk domestic politics on foreign soil. But does anyone cares it now?""There is a very healthy rule that no policy statement will be made outside Parliament when Parliament is in session. But are we observing that rule? We have all accepted all these as if nothing has happened. This is where the danger lies,"" Mr Sinha cautioned.Stating that the Supreme Court is compromised of late, he said, ""an apex court judge retires one day and the next day says the CJI was under pressure. Now, the highest court of the land is compromised...Still it\'\'s business as usual for the civil society. It is very sad.""There are various areas where as citizens of a free democracy must assert their rights to tell the government of the day where they are wrong and where they must get off, Mr Sinha said.Addressing the same event, former SEBI chairman M Damodaran said think civil society needs to frame issues better. We need to recognise that all problems won\'\'t be solved overnight so we need to prioritise the sequence, frame the issues and approach them right.5 COMMENTSHe also said today institutions have lost self respect as they function as if they are attached of subordinate offices. ""This way our institutions have destroyed themselves. They don\'t recognise when they hit the self destruct button.""']"

The report was submitted to the Railway Board last year.The creation of a new zone in Andhra Pradesh would be ""like putting many nails in the coffin of the Indian Railways"", it had said.A new railway zone in Andhra Pradesh has been a long-standing demand of the ruling TDP in the state. In a memorandum submitted to Mr Goyal, the BJP delegation had said that the north Andhra region, comprising Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts, was ""very backward and needs impetus for development"".The new zone will comprise the existing Guntakal, Guntur and Vijayawada divisions that currently fall under the South Central Railway.The South Central Railway will then consist of the Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Nanded divisions, Mr Goyal said.Waltair division, one of the three divisions of the East Coast Railway Zone, covering the northern districts of Andhra Pradesh, parts of Chhattisgarh and Odisha, having its headquarter in Visakhapatnam, will be split into two, he said.While one part will be incorporated in the new zone and merged with the neighbouring Vijaywada division, the remaining portion will be converted into a new division, headquartered at Rayagada, under the East Coast Railway (ECoR).The internal report had questioned the need for a separate zone and remarked that it was not ""feasible"".The Indian Railways\' operations are currently divided into 17 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions, each having a divisional headquarter. There are a total of 73 divisions at present.In 2002-2003, seven new zones and eight new divisions were created and the Salem division was added in 2007.During 2009-2013, 92 requests for new zones and 45 new divisions were received. These were examined by a committee formed in 2012. The committee in its report had said that ""none of the requests were justified"".1 COMMENTThe cost of creating infrastructure for a new zone, according to an internal assessment of the Railways, is around Rs 205 crore.
