"['New Delhi:Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to contest from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, the parliamentary seat he retained after winning two seats in the 2014 election.There has been speculation that in the April-May national election, the Prime Minister may opt for another temple town, Puri, but top party sources say he is likely to stick with Varanasi.PM Modi had, in an interview to news agency ANI, not confirmed or denied whether he would contest from the Odisha constituency. ""Media persons also should get some work,"" he had said.The BJP parliamentary board is apparently strongly in favour of a PM Modi encore in Varanasi. It is not clear, however, whether he will contest from a second seat and whether that seat will be Puri.In 2014, PM Modi, 68, contested from Varanasi as well as Vadodara in his home state Gujarat. After winning both, he decided to retain the holy city in Uttar Pradesh.In Varanasi, he won with a huge margin over his rivals Arvind Kejriwal and Congress\'s Ajay Rai.The Puri speculation does confirm the BJP\'s determination to improve its score in states like Bengal, Odisha and its neighbour Andhra Pradesh.–– ADVERTISEMENT ––The BJP\'s assessment is that having PM Modi as a candidate shored up its tally in Uttar Pradesh, where it won a staggering 71 of 80 seats in 2014. With recent disappointments in UP (by-polls) and other big northern states Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh - the party lost both to the Congress - the BJP sees more potential in Odisha, Bengal and other states in the region, say sources.In both Bengal and Odisha, the BJP came second in key polls.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra is believed to have set his sights on Puri. Sources say he and many other spokespersons are keen on contesting the polls for a chance at graduating from TV studios to parliament.The BJP\'s central election committee meeting this week may finalise candidates and seats. COMMENTVaranasi will vote on May 19, in the last round of seven-phase polls that start on April 11. The results will be declared on May 23.']"

NDTV has learnt that contrary to these claims, the British authorities have had no response to several queries they\'ve sent for information. In fact, a legal team from the UK also offered to come to India to help facilitate action against Nirav Modi but allegedly got no response from India.NDTV has learnt from the Serious Fraud Office in London that the first time that India sent an alert to the UK was under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) way back in February 2018. This was soon after the CBI first registered the criminal case against Nirav Modi and his family members for cheating the taxpayer of Rs. 13,000 crores of money in the Punjab National Bank Scam.While earlier, legal assistance for catching offenders abroad could be tedious and time-taking, the legal assistance treaty meant that the Home Ministry could directly forward summons or warrants to the Indian High Commission in London, which would then forward it to the central authority. In this case, the central authority in Britain decided that between the crown prosecution service and the SFO, it was the serious frauds office that was more appropriate to handle a request for taking action against Nirav Modi.The Serious Frauds Office confirmed to India by March that Nirav Modi was in the UK. At that time, Indian officials were struggling to determine whether he was in Europe or Hong Kong; it was only months later that they confirmed he was in the UK. The frauds office also assigned a counsel to help India with its case -- lawyer Barry Stancombe, a junior barrister who specialises in fraud and money laundering.NDTV has learnt that Stancombe and his team, while going through India\'s request, realized they needed many more documents. They wrote three letters that summer, to which they received no response. They also communicated, NDTV has learnt, that they were willing to make a visit to India to collect evidence so that they can arrest Nirav Modi, but that did not get a response.Meanwhile, Nirav Modi built his legal team in anticipation of the UK acting on India\'s requests. Working on his request for asylum was the legal firm Mischcon, being handled by a lawyer called Kamal Rehman, and there was a second team led by Anand Doobey to work on his extradition case.The Ministry of External affairs confirmed on Saturday that by August, two extradition requests were sent from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate.

He said the party will take a decision on Mathura soon.Asked how the workers of the three parties will be able to connect at the ground level with the seat-sharing talks having taken a long time, Jayant said he believes regional parties have a better connect with their workers.""This alliance decision was not a top-down process but in fact taken after feedback from workers and leaders. That is why you haven\'t seen problems in accommodation and adjustments between the BSP, SP and RLD. This means that the ground is already ready for us. Now we just need to keep up the campaign,"" the 40-year-old leader said.On the equation between the Congress and the grand alliance in UP, Mr Chaudhary said the issue had been addressed at the recent press interaction in Lucknow and he did not have any more information on it.After repeated questions by reporters at the press conference, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had said the Congress was ""very much in the alliance"". ""We have left two seats (Amethi and Rae Bareli) for the party (Congress),"" he had said.Jayant, grandson of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, said the electoral contest between the opposition and the BJP would be a ""make or break"" for the right idea of India.""The mainstreaming of violence, the \'\'othering\'\' of our minorities and weaker sections, the saffron washing of our cultural heritage, the nonchalance with which even our intelligentsia is ready to dismiss diverse opinions, the intentioned and sustained attack on institutional credibility, make this a make or break for our idea of an inclusive, progressive, developing Bharat!"" he said.Asked about the narrative of Modi versus the rest and the BJP\'\'s ""mahamilavat"" (highly adulterated) barb at opposition alliances, the RLD leader said the fact is that the diversity of India can have true political representation only through alliances.The BJP also ran a government in alliance with many parties and will have tie-ups in many states including UP, he said.Slamming the BJP for the PM Modi versus the rest narrative and the ""mahamilavat"" jibe, Mr Chaudhary said leaders don\'t walk alone, they build a team of capable leaders and this has been Modi\'s ""big failure"" in government.""We know that he likes to work alone and walk alone, but India needs a leadership that listens to feedback, collaborates with others and respects diversity,"" he said.Hitting out at the use of the term ""mahamilavat"" by PM Modi and the BJP, he said it betrays a ""negative mindset"".""The notion of purity was the basic foundation of caste oppression in India. To imply that the opposition is impure, to me, this slogan uses the language and symbolism that divided our country into castes and that is why I strongly object to it,"" he said.Asked whether national security and the post-Pulwama airstrikes will be the major issues in UP or the alleged agrarian distress, Mr Chaudhary said it is the ""jawan and kisan who have borne the brunt of the myopic and adhoc policies the incumbent government has unleashed over last five years"".""Therefore, both will feature prominently. Note ban had a debilitating impact on rural livelihoods, and economic activities in our hinterland. Farmers have faced rising input costs, depressed produce prices and diminishing returns,"" he alleged.Rural labourers and artisans, as well as dairy farmers have also suffered.

"['Lucknow:Uttar Pradesh will vote in all seven phases from April 11 to May 19 in the national election. With the maximum number of seats, the politically vital state is set to host the most-watched election battle that will test an opposition alliance of bitter rivals Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, joining hands to take on the BJP, which scooped a colossal 73 seats in the 2014 election.The route to power at the Centre is through Uttar Pradesh, and the BJP\'s sweep in the last polls was seen as the big chunk in its 2014 landslide; it was the first party to win a majority on its own in three decades.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the 71 BJP lawmakers who won in UP. The Samajwadi party won five, the Congress two and Mayawati\'s BSP won zero. The BJP followed up its Lok Sabha feat by ousting the Samajwadi Party in the state election in 2017.This time, the BJP faces a resurgent opposition that has already bagged telling victories in recent by-polls. Two of those wins was particularly sweet for the opposition - the BJP lost two strongholds, including Gorakhpur, the home base of its star campaigner Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.The biggest takeaway from these polls for the opposition was that if Mayawati\'s BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Akhilesh Yadav\'s Samajwadi Party team up, then beating the BJP is not impossible. Together, the two parties can potentially win over 40 seats. Along with the Congress, that could go up to 50.The two announced their alliance for the national election in January, but delivered a blow to the opposition ""gathbandhan"" bonhomie by leaving out the Congress.Days later, the Congress served its reply. The grand old party - for decades an also-ran in UP -- announced the debut of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as its campaign in-charge for the state along with Jyotiraditya Scindia.Priyanka Gandhi, the younger sister of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, had so far confined herself to Amethi and Raebareli, the constituencies of her brother and her mother Sonia Gandhi.The Congress is banking on Priyanka Gandhi\'s charisma and connect - and striking resemblance to her grandmother Indira Gandhi - to improve its score in Uttar Pradesh. It managed to retain only the Gandhis\' seats in 2014; anything more than that will be an improvement.Confronting an aggressive opposition, the BJP has upped its game. Over the past few months, PM Modi has focused on UP and his constituency Varanasi. The party has managed to appease upset smaller allies like Apna Dal and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party that had felt ""neglected"".5 COMMENTSYogi Adityanath and his government went all out to organize the Kumbh Mela, a massive religious gathering at Prayagraj that draws millions for a dip at the confluence of holy rivers.

Name the sector and there will be a Congress scam- from defence, telecom, irrigation, sporting events to agriculture, rural development and more.""He accused Congress leaders of ""filling their own bank accounts and lead luxurious lifestyles at the cost of providing basic necessities to the poor"".PM Modi also accused the Congress of going the ""Dynasty First"" way even though Mahatma Gandhi ""despised"" dynastic politics.Referring to the Emergency of 1975 imposed by the Indira Gandhi-led Congress government, PM Modi wrote: ""A firm believer in democracy, Bapu said, \'I understand democracy as something that gives the weak the same chance as the strong.\' Ironically, the Congress gave the nation the Emergency, when our democratic spirit was trampled over. The Congress misused Article 356 several times. If they did not like a leader, that Government was dismissed. Always eager to promote dynastic culture, Congress has no regard for democratic values.""He quoted Gandhi as saying: ""I am sorry to have to say that many Congressmen have looked upon this item (Swaraj) as a mere political necessity and not as something indispensable....I would go to the length of giving the whole Congress a decent burial, rather than put up with the corruption that is rampant."" COMMENTHe signed off with the comment that ""thankfully"", today the country has a government that is ""working on Bapu\'s path and a Jan Shakti that is fulfilling his dream of freeing India from the Congress Culture!""']"

NDTV has learnt that contrary to these claims, the British authorities have had no response to several queries they\'ve sent for information. In fact, a legal team from the UK also offered to come to India to help facilitate action against Nirav Modi but allegedly got no response from India.NDTV has learnt from the Serious Fraud Office in London that the first time that India sent an alert to the UK was under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) way back in February 2018. This was soon after the CBI first registered the criminal case against Nirav Modi and his family members for cheating the taxpayer of Rs 13,000 crores of money in the Punjab National Bank Scam.While earlier, legal assistance for catching offenders abroad could be tedious and time-taking, the legal assistance treaty meant that the Home Ministry could directly forward summons or warrants to the Indian High Commission in London, which would then forward it to the central authority. In this case, the central authority in Britain decided that between the crown prosecution service and the SFO, it was the serious frauds office that was more appropriate to handle a request for taking action against Nirav Modi.The Serious Frauds Office confirmed to India by March that Nirav Modi was in the UK. At that time, Indian officials were struggling to determine whether he was in Europe or Hong Kong; it was only months later that they confirmed he was in the UK. The frauds office also assigned a counsel to help India with its case -- lawyer Barry Stancombe, a junior barrister who specialises in fraud and money laundering.NDTV has learnt that Stancombe and his team, while going through India\'s request, realized they needed many more documents. They wrote three letters that summer, to which they received no response. They also communicated, NDTV has learnt, that they were willing to make a visit to India to collect evidence so that they can arrest Nirav Modi, but that did not get a response.Meanwhile, Nirav Modi built his legal team in anticipation of the UK acting on India\'s requests. Working on his request for asylum was the legal firm Mischcon, being handled by a lawyer called Kamal Rehman, and there was a second team led by Anand Doobey to work on his extradition case.The Ministry of External affairs confirmed on Saturday that by August, two extradition requests were sent from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate. On the UK asking for more documents, the spokesperson denied it and said: ""We are not aware of the request for any additional documents.\'\'Sources told NDTV that by December, the Serious Frauds office had stopped pursuing the case due to the ""lack of interest\'\' on India\'s part.

But according to a government press release, the plant, inaugurated in 2007, began production of carbines, rifles, and INSAS machine guns in late 2010.Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated to the nation a Kalashnikov Assault Rifle Production plant in Uttar Pradesh\'s Amethi.In another instance, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for a sewage network at Karmalichak in Bihar on February 17. However, he had laid the foundation stone for the Karmalichak sewage treatment plant under the same project in October 2017.Several of these projects launched - close to 140 - appeared to be too minor to merit an inauguration by the Prime Minister. For example, the inauguration of passenger service for a section of Chennai Metro, the doubling of the Chikjajur-Mayakonda section of a railway line in Karnataka, four-laning of the National Highway(NH)-45C from Vikravandi to Thanjavur and six-laning of the Karaipettai-Walajapet section of NH-4, both in Tamil Nadu.Some launches appeared to be at municipality level, such as laying a foundation stone for the refurbishment of a gaushala (cow shelter) under the Ghaziabad Municipality, and inaugurating a 37 km sewage line, sewer facilities for 9,000 houses and so on in the same city near Delhi.PM Modi launched a power plant in Bihar\'s Buxar through a video conference from Uttar Pradesh.Given the shortage of time, the Prime Minister also took to remotely launching at least 17 of the projects in the last month, including an instance from Saturday, as he launched a power plant in Bihar\'s Buxar through a video conference from Uttar Pradesh.88 COMMENTSEnquiries sent to the Prime Minister\'s Office and the Press Information Bureau were not met with a response.']"

He said the party will take a decision on Mathura soon.Asked how the workers of the three parties will be able to connect at the ground level with the seat-sharing talks having taken a long time, Jayant said he believes regional parties have a better connect with their workers.""This alliance decision was not a top-down process but in fact taken after feedback from workers and leaders. That is why you haven\'t seen problems in accommodation and adjustments between the BSP, SP and RLD. This means that the ground is already ready for us. Now we just need to keep up the campaign,"" the 40-year-old leader said.On the equation between the Congress and the grand alliance in UP, Mr Chaudhary said the issue had been addressed at the recent press interaction in Lucknow and he did not have any more information on it.After repeated questions by reporters at the press conference, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had said the Congress was ""very much in the alliance"". ""We have left two seats (Amethi and Rae Bareli) for the party (Congress),"" he had said.Jayant, grandson of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, said the electoral contest between the opposition and the BJP would be a ""make or break"" for the right idea of India.""The mainstreaming of violence, the \'\'othering\'\' of our minorities and weaker sections, the saffron washing of our cultural heritage, the nonchalance with which even our intelligentsia is ready to dismiss diverse opinions, the intentioned and sustained attack on institutional credibility, make this a make or break for our idea of an inclusive, progressive, developing Bharat!"" he said.Asked about the narrative of Modi versus the rest and the BJP\'\'s ""mahamilavat"" (highly adulterated) barb at opposition alliances, the RLD leader said the fact is that the diversity of India can have true political representation only through alliances.The BJP also ran a government in alliance with many parties and will have tie-ups in many states including UP, he said.Slamming the BJP for the PM Modi versus the rest narrative and the ""mahamilavat"" jibe, Mr Chaudhary said leaders don\'t walk alone, they build a team of capable leaders and this has been Modi\'s ""big failure"" in government.""We know that he likes to work alone and walk alone, but India needs a leadership that listens to feedback, collaborates with others and respects diversity,"" he said.Hitting out at the use of the term ""mahamilavat"" by PM Modi and the BJP, he said it betrays a ""negative mindset"".""The notion of purity was the basic foundation of caste oppression in India. To imply that the opposition is impure, to me, this slogan uses the language and symbolism that divided our country into castes and that is why I strongly object to it,"" he said.Asked whether national security and the post-Pulwama airstrikes will be the major issues in UP or the alleged agrarian distress, Mr Chaudhary said it is the ""jawan and kisan who have borne the brunt of the myopic and adhoc policies the incumbent government has unleashed over last five years"".""Therefore, both will feature prominently.

With the maximum number of seats, the politically vital state is set to host the most-watched election battle that will test an opposition alliance of bitter rivals Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, joining hands to take on the BJP, which scooped a colossal 73 seats in the 2014 election.The route to power at the Centre is through Uttar Pradesh, and the BJP\'s sweep in the last polls was seen as the big chunk in its 2014 landslide; it was the first party to win a majority on its own in three decades.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the 71 BJP lawmakers who won in UP. The Samajwadi party won five, the Congress two and Mayawati\'s BSP won zero. The BJP followed up its Lok Sabha feat by ousting the Samajwadi Party in the state election in 2017.This time, the BJP faces a resurgent opposition that has already bagged telling victories in recent by-polls. Two of those wins was particularly sweet for the opposition - the BJP lost two strongholds, including Gorakhpur, the home base of its star campaigner Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.The biggest takeaway from these polls for the opposition was that if Mayawati\'s BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Akhilesh Yadav\'s Samajwadi Party team up, then beating the BJP is not impossible. Together, the two parties can potentially win over 40 seats. Along with the Congress, that could go up to 50.The two announced their alliance for the national election in January, but delivered a blow to the opposition ""gathbandhan"" bonhomie by leaving out the Congress.Days later, the Congress served its reply. The grand old party - for decades an also-ran in UP -- announced the debut of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as its campaign in-charge for the state along with Jyotiraditya Scindia.Priyanka Gandhi, the younger sister of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, had so far confined herself to Amethi and Raebareli, the constituencies of her brother and her mother Sonia Gandhi.The Congress is banking on Priyanka Gandhi\'s charisma and connect - and striking resemblance to her grandmother Indira Gandhi - to improve its score in Uttar Pradesh. It managed to retain only the Gandhis\' seats in 2014; anything more than that will be an improvement.Confronting an aggressive opposition, the BJP has upped its game.

"['New Delhi:The anti-thesis of Gandhian thought is Congress culture, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote today in a blog on the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi\'s 1930 Dandi March, targeting the opposition party and the Gandhi family on a day the Congress Working Committee meets for a strategy session in his home state Gujarat.PM Modi began with an ode to ""the great Sardar Patel"", who, he said, had a key role in planning ""every minute aspect of the Dandi March, down to the last detail"". The Congress accuses the BJP of trying to appropriate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, one of its most iconic leaders and India\'s first home minister.""In many of his works, Gandhi Ji said that he does not believe in inequality and caste divisions. Sadly, the Congress has never hesitated from dividing society. The worst caste riots and anti-Dalit massacres happened under Congress rule,"" PM Modi wrote in the blog, listing a point-by-point contrast of Gandhi\'s thoughts and ""Congress culture"".Gandhi, said the Prime Minister, had understood the Congress culture very well, ""which is why he wanted the Congress disbanded, especially after 1947"".Quoting Gandhi as saying that misgovernance and corruption always go together, PM Modi said while his government had ""done everything"" to punish the corrupt, ""...the nation has seen how Congress and corruption have become synonyms. Name the sector and there will be a Congress scam- from defence, telecom, irrigation, sporting events to agriculture, rural development and more.""He accused Congress leaders of ""filling their own bank accounts and lead luxurious lifestyles at the cost of providing basic necessities to the poor"".PM Modi also accused the Congress of going the ""Dynasty First"" way even though Mahatma Gandhi ""despised"" dynastic politics.Referring to the Emergency of 1975 imposed by the Indira Gandhi-led Congress government, PM Modi wrote: ""A firm believer in democracy, Bapu said, \'I understand democracy as something that gives the weak the same chance as the strong.\' Ironically, the Congress gave the nation the Emergency, when our democratic spirit was trampled over. The Congress misused Article 356 several times. If they did not like a leader, that Government was dismissed. Always eager to promote dynastic culture, Congress has no regard for democratic values.""He quoted Gandhi as saying: ""I am sorry to have to say that many Congressmen have looked upon this item (Swaraj) as a mere political necessity and not as something indispensable....I would go to the length of giving the whole Congress a decent burial, rather than put up with the corruption that is rampant."" COMMENTHe signed off with the comment that ""thankfully"", today the country has a government that is ""working on Bapu\'s path and a Jan Shakti that is fulfilling his dream of freeing India from the Congress Culture!""']"
