"['New Delhi:Congress president Rahul Gandhi Tuesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of acting as a middleman of Anil Ambani in the Rafale jet deal, as he cited an e-mail to claim the businessman was aware of the MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) before India and France signed it. Mr Gandhi\'s scathing attack onPM Modi on the Rafale fighter jet deal comes a day after repeating his allegation of corruption in the 36-jet deal. ""The Prime Ministeris acting as Anil Ambani\'s middleman,"" Mr Gandhi said.""National security has been compromised. An MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) is known to a businessman before it is drafted before anybody else. Like I said, the Prime Ministerhas done something that spies do,"" he said, addressing a press conference.Anil Ambani had met the French defence minister days before the signing of the deal during PM Modi\'s visit to France in 2015, Rahul Gandhi said, quoting from an e-mail written by an Airbus executive to a French official.The Congress president also rejected the national auditor CAG or Comptroller and Auditor General report on the Rafale deal, and dubbed it ""Chowkidar Auditor General"" report.The Congress alleges that the government finalised an overpriced deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets at an inflated price to benefit Anil Ambani, whose inexperienced defence firm was recommended as an offset partner for Dassault, the company manufacturing the aircraft. Both Dassault and the government have denied the allegations.Yesterday, Rahul Gandhi met Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who was on a day-long fast in the capital, to express his solidarity with Mr Naidu over his demand for special status for Andhra Pradesh ""The Prime Minister became prime minister saying he will fight corruption. Have you read today\'s Hindu? It is very clear in today\'s (Monday\'s) Hindu article that the PM removed the anti-corruption clause. Every defence deal has an anti-corruption clause,"" he said said Rahul Gandhi, once again prompting the gathering at Mr Naidu\'s protest at Andhra Bhawan to say, ""Chowkidar chor hai"".

"['Dehradun:Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi today said prohibition cannot work everywhere as it did in his state.Replying to a question on the recent hooch tragedy of Uttarakhand in which many people from the state as well as neighbouring Uttar Pradesh died after drinking spurious liquor, he said the incident was unfortunate and should not be linked with the feasibility of the idea of prohibition.Over 60 people have died in two adjoining districts in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, with more people dying of the spurious liquor they drank at a Haridwar village.More than 20 victims died in Balupur and its neighbouring villages in Haridwar district and around 40 have died in UP\'s Saharanpur district.The Bihar deputy CM was in the city in connection with the BJP\'s month-long ""Bharat ke Man ki Baat Modi ke Saath"" campaign.""Prohibition may have worked in Bihar but it cannot work everywhere. Different states have different circumstances and it is up to their respective chief ministers to decide whether or not imposing prohibition will be a practical idea,"" Mr Modi said.Imposing prohibition in Bihar was comparatively easier because liquor consumption was never a part of the Bihari culture, he said.""It is not like this in all states. Alcohol consumption is not a taboo in several of them. Fathers and sons take it together,"" Mr Modi said when asked whether prohibition should be imposed in Uttarakhand in the wake of the hooch tragedy.Pitching for stricter laws to punish people engaged in the manufacture and sale of illicit liquor, the Bihar deputy CM said it should be studied why such people should not be handed death sentence or life imprisonment.""If someone can be hanged or sentenced to life in prison for murdering someone why shouldn\'t those making spurious liquor be given similar punishment for killing dozens of unsuspecting people?"" he asked.Mr Modi also claimed that a section of the Bihari media, legal and medical professionals are up in arms against the state government for bringing prohibition and want an end to it.But expressing the state government\'\'s resolve to fight the social evils of alcoholism, dowry and child marriages, he said it will not rest until they were totally eliminated.1 COMMENTThe BJP on February 3 launched the ""Bharat ke mann ki baat, Modi ke saath"" campaign to seek suggestions from people across the country to help the party prepare its \'\'sankalp patra\'\' for the general election, expected to be held in April-May.']"

""You are senior in changing parties, in entering alliance with new parties, you are senior in backstabbing your own father-in-law, losing election after election, and you are senior in shattering the dreams of Andhra Pradesh.""PM Modi wondered why Mr Naidu bowed before the Congress which insulted the leaders of AndhraPradesh which led to N.T. Rama Rao forming the TDP.The Prime Minister said Naidu forgot the principles of his own party as he did not want to face the truth. He said Naidu never won successive elections and was afraid of miserably losing the coming elections.PM Modi alleged that from Amaravati to Polavaram all the efforts of Naidu were to create wealth for himself. ""That\'s why he is afraid of \'Chowkidar\'. My government calls for account of every rupee of the taxpayer\'s money.

""PM has taken Andhra money and given it to Anil Ambani,"" the Congress president declared, repeating his allegation of corruption in the 36-jet deal to benefit the industrialist.""The Prime Minister became prime minister saying he will fight corruption. Have you read today\'s Hindu? It is very clear in today\'s Hindu article that the PM removed the anti-corruption clause.

He goes to Andhra, he lies, he goes to the Northeast, he lies,"" the Congress president added.The Hindu newspaper has reported that provisions for anti-corruption penalties and an escrow account for payments were dropped days before the Rafale deal was signed, in what it calls ""major and unprecedented concessions"" from a government that has repeatedly stressed on fighting corruption in defence deals.The newspaper had earlier reported on defence ministry objections to ""parallel negotiations"" conducted by the Prime Minister\'s Office.The Congress alleges that the government finalised an overpriced deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets at an inflated price to benefit Anil Ambani, whose inexperienced defence firm was recommended as an offset partner for Dassault, the company manufacturing the aircraft. Both Dassault and the government have denied the allegations.17 COMMENTSDisclaimer: NDTV has been sued for 10,000 crores by Anil Ambani\'s Reliance Group for its coverage of the Rafale deal']"
"['Priyanka Gandhi In Lucknow: A smiling Priyanka Gandhi Vadra kicked off her Lucknow roadshowNew Delhi:Priyanka Gandhi Vadra reached Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow this morning and kicked off a rally accompanied by her brother Congress President Rahul Gandhi and senior party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, seen as the Congress\' big hope for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, announced her entry into politics as the party\'s general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. Reviving Congress fortunes in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh will be a symbolic victory for the party as Allahabad has been home to the Nehru family and was also former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Sastri\'s Lok Sabha seat. Neighbouring Phulpur used to be India\'s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru\'s Lok Sabha seat.The last two Lok Sabha elections in eastern Uttar Pradesh, for the Gorakhpur and Phulpur constituencies, were disastrous for the Congress. Congress candidates managed to fetch only around 19,000 votes each and registered only a 2% vote share in each constituency.Eastern Uttar Pradesh currently has strongholds of both Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.A 30-kilometre long roadshow is planned in Lucknow as a grand welcome for the top three Congress leaders, through some of the most congested areas of the city.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will, in the course of the next three days, conduct daily meetings over specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats which fall under her purview. Sources say instead of returning to Delhi after her Lucknow visit, she may tour eastern Uttar Pradesh.Here are the Highlightson Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\'s Lucknow Roadshow:Feb 11, 201920:35 (IST)--> Visuals of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress\' new general secretary meeting her young fans during roadshow today.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-in-uttar-pradesh-live-updates-priyanka-gandhi-to-kick-off-congress-rally-in-lucknow-1991406?q_id=34"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Feb 11, 201919:35 (IST)-->Congress President Rahul Gandhi, senior party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra drink chai during their roadshow in UP.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-in-uttar-pradesh-live-updates-priyanka-gandhi-to-kick-off-congress-rally-in-lucknow-1991406?q_id=33"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Feb 11, 201917:57 (IST)-->""Congress cannot remain weak in UP"", says Rahul GandhiCongress cannot remain weak in Uttar Pradesh.

Rahul Gandhi, brother and Congress president, had announced her entry into politics as the party\'s general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. Priyanka Gandhi will be accompanied by Jyotiraditya Scindia, the party\'s western Uttar Pradesh in-charge, and the Congress chief on the occasion.""Tomorrow, I hope that we can all come together to bring about a new kind of politics. A kind of politics in which all of you will be stakeholders. A kind of politics in which the voice of my youth friends, my sisters and the poorest of the poor will be heard,"" she told supporters through the party\'s Shakti App on Sunday.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visit. From Lucknow airport, all three leaders will proceed to the city\'s Congress office in a roadshow running well over 30 kilometres through some of the most congested areas of the city - garlanding statues of Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar along the way. Congress leaders and workers will gather to welcome her and the others at 14 different points on the route, and party workers from neighbouring districts have been called in to ensure good public presence.After reaching the Congress office, Priyanka Gandhi and the other leaders are expected to address a press conference and inaugurate a new media centre.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visitOver the next three to four days, she is likely to frequent the party office and chair daily meetings on specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats that fall under her purview. Congress sources say that once Priyanka Gandhi is done with Lucknow, she may embark on a tour of eastern Uttar Pradesh instead of returning to DelhiBut while the Congress believes that Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry will boost its prospects in the Lok Sabha elections, with her charisma and voter connect being touted as the major draws, a reality check suggests that it could still be a daunting task. The last two Lok Sabha elections in eastern UP - the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls of 2018 - turned out to be disastrous for the party. On both seats, its candidates managed only about 19,000 votes each and a 2% vote share in each constituency.The 2014 Lok Sabha polls was just as tragic for the Congress, bagging just two seats - Amethi and Raebareli - as compared to the 21 it had won five years earlier. The party\'s vote share also dropped by almost 50% between 2009 and 2014. So, the question is: Does Priyanka Gandhi have the time to revive the party\'s seemingly defunct grassroots organisation?Sources say the party decided on Priyanka Gandhi\'s foray into eastern Uttar Pradesh after much thought, and the leadership believes that reviving it in eastern Uttar Pradesh would amount to achieving a symbolic victory.75 COMMENTSAllahabad (or Prayagraj, as it is called now) was Lal Bahadur Shastri\'s Lok Sabha seat and home to the Nehru family. Neighbouring Phulpur was Jawaharlal Nehru\'s Lok Sabha seat. East Uttar Pradesh also has the strongholds of both Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a good showing in a direct fight can boost the party\'s morale immensely. Failure is a possibility too, but that\'s a chance Priyanka Gandhi and her brother are willing to take.']"
"['New Delhi:Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will complement Congress president Rahul Gandhi\'s efforts in winning over young voters and the brother-sister combine will be a game changer for the party in the Lok Sabha polls as the country needs a young team, technocrat-turned-politician Sam Pitroda said on Sunday.He said the Rahul Gandhi-Priyanka Gandhi Vadra duo will make a ""great team"" along with many other young leaders active in the party, including Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Milind Deora, as people who can take the country forward, rather than keeping it hung up on history and religion.Mr Pitroda, the Indian Overseas Congress chief and a long-time friend of the Gandhi family, also said Rahul Gandhi has learnt a lot from the 2014 elections and is much more ""mature, stronger, wiser"", and ready to take on the job of Prime Minister.In an interview with PTI from Chicago, he said India needs a young person with a new inclusive vision of the future, focus on employment, and new opportunities for all, to lead.""India today needs somebody who believes in teamwork, collaboration and cooperation as opposed to a centralised power centre. India today really needs someone who believes in truth rather than lies, who believes in trust and not mistrust, who believes in inclusion and not exclusion. Rahul is at the right age to lead India,"" Mr Pitroda said.Asked about Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry into active politics as AICC general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh East, he said she will be a ""great asset and a good politician"".""She will complement her brother\'s efforts. She will join him in getting young people excited, especially women. They are both young, they represent a large young team in the party, they are modern, they are tech-savvy with a healthy respect for history and new vision for the future.""I am confident that they will attract more young people in the mainstream and that is what a young India needs,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who divides his time between the US and India, is seen as a key adviser of the Gandhis.Asked if the Rahul-Priyanka team will be a game changer for the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls, expected in April-May, he said: ""I think it will be. People will see the benefit of a younger team with a modern outlook. The country needs to look forward rather than backwards, and not get hung up on history and religion.""""But it is not just the Rahul-Priyanka combine. The party has many other young people like Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Milind Deora, to name just a few,"" he said.Mr Pitroda said he is hopeful that Priyanka Gandhi\'s coming into active politics will have a big impact on the polls.Priyanka Gandhi, 47, and Mr Scindia, 48, took charge as AICC general secretary UP east and UP west respectively last week. Mr Pilot, 41, was made deputy chief minister of Rajasthan in December 2018 after the Congress wrested power from BJP. He as well as Mr Deora, 42, and Mr Scindia had served as Union ministers in the last UPA government at the centre.Rahul Gandhi, 48, took charge as Congress chief in December 2017.However, the Congress party has had several presidents who took charge at a younger age, including his father Rajiv Gandhi, grandmother Indira Gandhi, and maternal great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru, as also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.On the BJP\'s charge that the Congress was promoting dynastic politics, Mr Pitroda said dynasty is in every business, but ultimately it is the performance that matters. If you do not perform dynasty cannot help, he said.Rahul Gandhi\'s popularity has increased exponentially after becoming Congress president because once he took over the party, he has had a free hand, Mr Pitroda said.""He could do things that he wanted to do. Earlier, he was constrained in some ways. After becoming Congress president, he had to leave his mark, bring in a young team, respect the old guards, and realise that going forward, he would need new thinking and new blood, and that is what he is trying to do,"" said Mr Pitroda, who headed the Knowledge Commission during the tenure of Manmohan Singh.He said Gandhi has the qualities to make a good prime minister because his heart is in the right place and he is keen on working for the greater good of India and its people.""He (Gandhi) is not driven by personal and vested interests. He is driven by the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid. He is driven by opportunities for the young. He is driven by the welfare of farmers. He is driven by the idea of inclusion...he believes in the idea of India that our founding fathers had,"" Mr Pitroda said.To a question on whether Rahul Gandhi\'s NRI events in foreign countries were similar to the ones Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had during his overseas visits, he said it was not so and the idea behind the trips was not just to have big events with NRIs, but to meet local political and business leaders, interact with students, interact with members of the Indian Overseas Congress, NRIs, and then have a big event to be able to meet them en masse.""He (Gandhi) interacts with students wherever he goes, so it is a different format,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who has worked closely with both Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, said they cannot be compared as there is big difference between the India 35 years back and the India now, but added that both were very open to new ideas.4 COMMENTSMr Pitroda led the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi when he set up the C-DOT. He worked on the Knowledge Commission and also founded National Innovation Council later during the Congress-led UPA rule.']"

What has been the corruption record of Indiraji (former prime minister), his grandmother? We have never used the kind of language he has used against Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" the Law Minister said.The Congress-led UPA government couldn\'t close the Rafale deal as it didn\'t see any benefits and ignored the Indian Air Force\'s urgent needs, Mr Prasad alleged.""As they did not get commission, therefore they kept it (deal) pending,"" he alleged.The basic price of the Rafale fighter negotiated by the centre is cheaper than what the UPA had agreed to, the BJP leader reiterated.The UPA government was negotiating with Dassault Aviation, that manufactures Rafale fighters, for 126 jets, of which 18 jets were to supplied in a ready-to-fly condition and 108 were to be manufactured in India by the French company along with the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).

In 2013, Mr Gandhi trashed the ordinance as ""nonsense"" and it was withdrawn by the cabinet.Mr Krishna further said the reason for the alleged scams during the Congress rule was coalition politics.""In my second tenure during UPA, I was minister for External Affairs. I was also part of the cabinet joint responsibility framework. It was not a conducive environment for governance.

And in that context, an additional Rs 500 does not sound so little. It should not be dismissed, neither should it be demeaned.""This amount can be used (by a farmer) to send his child to school, to buy rations, to buy water from large land-owners, and so many other things. It\'s not a small amount,"" he said.""Another way to look at it is that in 10 years, you get Rs 60,000. It\'s not a one-time sop. It\'s a long-term relief. In terms of government expenditure, Rs 75,000 crore becomes Rs 7.5 lakh crore in 10 years. It\'s a fair, significant fiscal burden,"" he added.Mr Kumar said that one can always criticize a measure saying it is too little, but it has to be balanced with fiscal responsibility.""Having seen poor households, I don\'t think the sum is too small. It is a significant percentage of total income, not something that disappears in the decimal as you would tend think.""He added the criticism that the scheme leaves out a large part of urban poor out of its net was also unfair and said only 13.7 per cent of farmers were tenants even out of which, 80 per cent owned some land or the other.""So hardly anyone is left out among the agriculture farming households. The only people who are not included are the landless labour. That is only 2.6 per cent of the rural population. That has been left out because for them, there is MNREGA. That is what gives them social security,"" Mr Kumar said.""The coverage is not narrow. It covers 12 crore households - around 60 crore people. It is much bigger than any farm loan waiver would cover, which are by nature skewed or biased towards larger land-owners.""In a sharp criticism of loan waiver schemes announced by the newly-formed governments in the Hindi-heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, he said it was not the answer to agricultural distress.""Farm distress can be sorted out through true modernisation of the sector - convert farmer from mere producer of commodities to a producer of agricultural value products. The second part of solving the crisis is to connect the farmer to the market - get logistics in place.68 COMMENTS""And finally, you have to lower the cost of production in agriculture. At the moment, Indian agriculture products are higher-priced than global prices. There I think, one has to move away from the model of increasing doses of chemical inputs into agriculture, resulting in higher cost, higher debt and higher distress. We need to shift to bio pesticides, bio-fertilizers,"" Mr Kumar said.']"

The Rajasthan High Court has directed him to cooperate with the agency in the case.The agency had registered a money laundering case in September 2015 alleging that Skylight Hospitality had acquired land in Kolayat village of Bikaner, which was meant for rehabilitation of poor villagers. It was alleged that Vadra bought 69.55 hectares of land at a cheaper rate and sold it to Allegheny Finlease for Rs. 5.15 crore through illegal transactions.During investigations, the agency claimed to have found Allengenery had no real business dealings and the shareholders were also found to be fake.Earlier, the CBI had also filed 18 cases at the instance of the Rajasthan government in August 2017 in connection with the Bikaner land deal case.Of the 18, four cases have been registered against Skylight Hospitality.According to ED sources, Mr Vadra will also be called for questioning in a money laundering case relating to a land deak in Gurugram\'s Shikohpur village after it registers a fresh case in the coming days.On January 23, the CBI had filed a case against former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and several others, including 15 private builders, for alleged irregularities in allotting over 1,417 acres of land during 2009-12 in Gurugram.The Haryana Police on September 2 last year has also registered a case against Mr Vadra and Hooda for alleged irregularities in land deals in Gurugram. Mr Vadra faces allegations that his company sold 3.5 acres of land in 2008 in Shikohpur village to DLF at a rate much higher than was prevailing at the time.The ED has also grilled Mr Vadra for in a money laundering case against his close aide Manoj Arora, whose role surfaced during a probe by the Income Tax Department into another case under against absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari.The London property was allegedly bought by Mr Bhandari and sold in 2010 for the same amount despite incurring additional expenses on its renovation.The ED says it has received information about various new properties in London which belong to Mr Vadra. These include two houses, one worth 5 million pounds and the other valued at 4 million pounds and six flats. The total worth of these properties is 12 million pounds.The ED also grilled Mr Vadra about the mails he exchanged with Sumit Chadha, a relative of Mr Bhandari, in reference to a London property. Mr Vadra was also asked how he knew Mr Bhandari and Mr Chadha and what business transactions they had.According to sources, Mr Vadra was confronted with the emails he had reportedly exchanged with Mr Chadha for the payment of the renovation of a London property, about which the agency informed a Delhi court.The ED also told the court that the London property was part of the kickbacks received in a petroleum deal.According to the ED, Mr Vadra and his associates received \'kickbacks\' in the petroleum deal signed in 2009 during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime.3 COMMENTSThe ED claimed that money was allegedly transferred to Santech International, FZC, a company based in UAE and controlled by Mr Bhandari.

Mr Vadra, the husband of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, wasgrilled for over 24 hours altogether for three days last week in another alleged money laundering case on purchase of a property in the UK worth 1.9 million pounds (approximately Rs. 17 crore).Investigators have accused Mr Vadra of letting the personal driver of an associate, Mahesh Nagar, pay for buying land in Rajasthan\'s Bikaner with a cheque drawn on behalf of his mother Maureen, and have questioned the manner in which the transaction was done.The mother-son duo, who landed in Jaipur on Monday afternoon, is expected to visit the probe agency\'s office on Bhawani Singh Road at 10 am on Tuesday.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also reached Jaipur late on Monday after wrapping up her mega roadshow in Lucknow.She is likely to drop off her husband and mother-in-law at the probe agency\'s office this morning. On the first day of Mr Vadra questioning in Delhi last week, Priyanka Gandhi had accompanied him to the ED\'s office as she wanted to send a ""clear message"" with her appearance. ""I stand by my husband,"" she had told NDTV.Last month, the businessman and his mother were told by the Rajasthan High Court to appear before the Enforcement Directorate for recording their statements, after they asked the court to ensure the probe agency refrain from taking any coercive action against them. Mr Vadra went to the court after he got at least three summons from the probe agency, according to news agency PTI.The Enforcement Directorate filed a money laundering case in 2015 after it took note of several First Information Reports (FIRs) filed by the Rajasthan Police, which received complaints from the Bikaner tehsildar on alleged forgery in land allotment in the area, considered sensitive due to its proximity to the border with Pakistan.In his complaint, the tehsildar said government land in 34 villages of Bikaner to be used for expanding the Army\'s firing range was ""grabbed"" by the land mafia with the help of ""forged and fabricated documents"", with the help of some government officials. The ED suspects a huge amount of money was laundered as people bought land at cheap rates through forged documents.The probe agency wants to question Mr Vadra about the operations of a firm, Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd, allegedly linked to him, which had bought land in Bikaner. The ED is likely to confront Mr Vadra with the statements of people who were aware of the transactions, PTI reported.The role of a big steel company that gave loans to another firm, which eventually bought the land from companies linked to Mr Vadra at an inflated price, will be investigated, officials in the probe team said.26 COMMENTSMr Vadra has denied any wrongdoing in the Bikaner case, and accused the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of going down the path of vendetta politics, more so at a time when his wife Priyanka Gandhi has been made the Congress\'s Lok Sabha election campaign in-charge in eastern Uttar Pradesh where the constituencies of PM Modi and the saffron-robed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minster Yogi Adityanath are located.']"

"['Priyanka Gandhi In Lucknow: A smiling Priyanka Gandhi Vadra kicked off her Lucknow roadshowNew Delhi:Priyanka Gandhi Vadra reached Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow this morning and kicked off a rally accompanied by her brother Congress President Rahul Gandhi and senior party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, seen as the Congress\' big hope for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, announced her entry into politics as the party\'s general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. Reviving Congress fortunes in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh will be a symbolic victory for the party as Allahabad has been home to the Nehru family and was also former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Sastri\'s Lok Sabha seat. Neighbouring Phulpur used to be India\'s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru\'s Lok Sabha seat.The last two Lok Sabha elections in eastern Uttar Pradesh, for the Gorakhpur and Phulpur constituencies, were disastrous for the Congress. Congress candidates managed to fetch only around 19,000 votes each and registered only a 2% vote share in each constituency.Eastern Uttar Pradesh currently has strongholds of both Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.A 30-kilometre long roadshow is planned in Lucknow as a grand welcome for the top three Congress leaders, through some of the most congested areas of the city.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will, in the course of the next three days, conduct daily meetings over specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats which fall under her purview. Sources say instead of returning to Delhi after her Lucknow visit, she may tour eastern Uttar Pradesh.Here are the Highlightson Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\'s Lucknow Roadshow:Feb 11, 201920:35 (IST)--> Visuals of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress\' new general secretary meeting her young fans during roadshow today.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-in-uttar-pradesh-live-updates-priyanka-gandhi-to-kick-off-congress-rally-in-lucknow-1991406?q_id=34"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Feb 11, 201919:35 (IST)-->Congress President Rahul Gandhi, senior party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra drink chai during their roadshow in UP.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-in-uttar-pradesh-live-updates-priyanka-gandhi-to-kick-off-congress-rally-in-lucknow-1991406?q_id=33"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Feb 11, 201917:57 (IST)-->""Congress cannot remain weak in UP"", says Rahul GandhiCongress cannot remain weak in Uttar Pradesh.

Rahul Gandhi, brother and Congress president, had announced her entry into politics as the party\'s general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. Priyanka Gandhi will be accompanied by Jyotiraditya Scindia, the party\'s western Uttar Pradesh in-charge, and the Congress chief on the occasion.""Tomorrow, I hope that we can all come together to bring about a new kind of politics. A kind of politics in which all of you will be stakeholders. A kind of politics in which the voice of my youth friends, my sisters and the poorest of the poor will be heard,"" she told supporters through the party\'s Shakti App on Sunday.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visit. From Lucknow airport, all three leaders will proceed to the city\'s Congress office in a roadshow running well over 30 kilometres through some of the most congested areas of the city - garlanding statues of Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar along the way. Congress leaders and workers will gather to welcome her and the others at 14 different points on the route, and party workers from neighbouring districts have been called in to ensure good public presence.After reaching the Congress office, Priyanka Gandhi and the other leaders are expected to address a press conference and inaugurate a new media centre.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visitOver the next three to four days, she is likely to frequent the party office and chair daily meetings on specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats that fall under her purview. Congress sources say that once Priyanka Gandhi is done with Lucknow, she may embark on a tour of eastern Uttar Pradesh instead of returning to DelhiBut while the Congress believes that Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry will boost its prospects in the Lok Sabha elections, with her charisma and voter connect being touted as the major draws, a reality check suggests that it could still be a daunting task. The last two Lok Sabha elections in eastern UP - the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls of 2018 - turned out to be disastrous for the party. On both seats, its candidates managed only about 19,000 votes each and a 2% vote share in each constituency.The 2014 Lok Sabha polls was just as tragic for the Congress, bagging just two seats - Amethi and Raebareli - as compared to the 21 it had won five years earlier. The party\'s vote share also dropped by almost 50% between 2009 and 2014. So, the question is: Does Priyanka Gandhi have the time to revive the party\'s seemingly defunct grassroots organisation?Sources say the party decided on Priyanka Gandhi\'s foray into eastern Uttar Pradesh after much thought, and the leadership believes that reviving it in eastern Uttar Pradesh would amount to achieving a symbolic victory.75 COMMENTSAllahabad (or Prayagraj, as it is called now) was Lal Bahadur Shastri\'s Lok Sabha seat and home to the Nehru family. Neighbouring Phulpur was Jawaharlal Nehru\'s Lok Sabha seat. East Uttar Pradesh also has the strongholds of both Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a good showing in a direct fight can boost the party\'s morale immensely. Failure is a possibility too, but that\'s a chance Priyanka Gandhi and her brother are willing to take.']"
"['New Delhi:Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will complement Congress president Rahul Gandhi\'s efforts in winning over young voters and the brother-sister combine will be a game changer for the party in the Lok Sabha polls as the country needs a young team, technocrat-turned-politician Sam Pitroda said on Sunday.He said the Rahul Gandhi-Priyanka Gandhi Vadra duo will make a ""great team"" along with many other young leaders active in the party, including Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Milind Deora, as people who can take the country forward, rather than keeping it hung up on history and religion.Mr Pitroda, the Indian Overseas Congress chief and a long-time friend of the Gandhi family, also said Rahul Gandhi has learnt a lot from the 2014 elections and is much more ""mature, stronger, wiser"", and ready to take on the job of Prime Minister.In an interview with PTI from Chicago, he said India needs a young person with a new inclusive vision of the future, focus on employment, and new opportunities for all, to lead.""India today needs somebody who believes in teamwork, collaboration and cooperation as opposed to a centralised power centre. India today really needs someone who believes in truth rather than lies, who believes in trust and not mistrust, who believes in inclusion and not exclusion. Rahul is at the right age to lead India,"" Mr Pitroda said.Asked about Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry into active politics as AICC general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh East, he said she will be a ""great asset and a good politician"".""She will complement her brother\'s efforts. She will join him in getting young people excited, especially women. They are both young, they represent a large young team in the party, they are modern, they are tech-savvy with a healthy respect for history and new vision for the future.""I am confident that they will attract more young people in the mainstream and that is what a young India needs,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who divides his time between the US and India, is seen as a key adviser of the Gandhis.Asked if the Rahul-Priyanka team will be a game changer for the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls, expected in April-May, he said: ""I think it will be. People will see the benefit of a younger team with a modern outlook. The country needs to look forward rather than backwards, and not get hung up on history and religion.""""But it is not just the Rahul-Priyanka combine. The party has many other young people like Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Milind Deora, to name just a few,"" he said.Mr Pitroda said he is hopeful that Priyanka Gandhi\'s coming into active politics will have a big impact on the polls.Priyanka Gandhi, 47, and Mr Scindia, 48, took charge as AICC general secretary UP east and UP west respectively last week. Mr Pilot, 41, was made deputy chief minister of Rajasthan in December 2018 after the Congress wrested power from BJP. He as well as Mr Deora, 42, and Mr Scindia had served as Union ministers in the last UPA government at the centre.Rahul Gandhi, 48, took charge as Congress chief in December 2017.However, the Congress party has had several presidents who took charge at a younger age, including his father Rajiv Gandhi, grandmother Indira Gandhi, and maternal great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru, as also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.On the BJP\'s charge that the Congress was promoting dynastic politics, Mr Pitroda said dynasty is in every business, but ultimately it is the performance that matters. If you do not perform dynasty cannot help, he said.Rahul Gandhi\'s popularity has increased exponentially after becoming Congress president because once he took over the party, he has had a free hand, Mr Pitroda said.""He could do things that he wanted to do. Earlier, he was constrained in some ways. After becoming Congress president, he had to leave his mark, bring in a young team, respect the old guards, and realise that going forward, he would need new thinking and new blood, and that is what he is trying to do,"" said Mr Pitroda, who headed the Knowledge Commission during the tenure of Manmohan Singh.He said Gandhi has the qualities to make a good prime minister because his heart is in the right place and he is keen on working for the greater good of India and its people.""He (Gandhi) is not driven by personal and vested interests. He is driven by the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid. He is driven by opportunities for the young. He is driven by the welfare of farmers. He is driven by the idea of inclusion...he believes in the idea of India that our founding fathers had,"" Mr Pitroda said.To a question on whether Rahul Gandhi\'s NRI events in foreign countries were similar to the ones Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had during his overseas visits, he said it was not so and the idea behind the trips was not just to have big events with NRIs, but to meet local political and business leaders, interact with students, interact with members of the Indian Overseas Congress, NRIs, and then have a big event to be able to meet them en masse.""He (Gandhi) interacts with students wherever he goes, so it is a different format,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who has worked closely with both Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, said they cannot be compared as there is big difference between the India 35 years back and the India now, but added that both were very open to new ideas.4 COMMENTSMr Pitroda led the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi when he set up the C-DOT. He worked on the Knowledge Commission and also founded National Innovation Council later during the Congress-led UPA rule.']"

What has been the corruption record of Indiraji (former prime minister), his grandmother? We have never used the kind of language he has used against Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" the Law Minister said.The Congress-led UPA government couldn\'t close the Rafale deal as it didn\'t see any benefits and ignored the Indian Air Force\'s urgent needs, Mr Prasad alleged.""As they did not get commission, therefore they kept it (deal) pending,"" he alleged.The basic price of the Rafale fighter negotiated by the centre is cheaper than what the UPA had agreed to, the BJP leader reiterated.The UPA government was negotiating with Dassault Aviation, that manufactures Rafale fighters, for 126 jets, of which 18 jets were to supplied in a ready-to-fly condition and 108 were to be manufactured in India by the French company along with the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).

It couldn\'t have been imagined that the trade of illicit liquor flourished at such a large scale in the two states,"" Priyanka Gandhi, who last month was made in-charge of the Congress\'s Lok Sabha election campaign in eastern Uttar Pradesh, said in a statement today.The number of people who died after consuming poisonous liquor reached 75 on Sunday; 32 died in Uttarakhand and 43 in Uttar Pradesh.More than 130 people have been arrested for making and selling illegal liquor, the police said.The tragedy took a political turn with the ruling BJP and the opposition parties including the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party, which have tied up for the national elections, trading charges of negligence in enforcing strict liquor manufacturing and sale regulations.""In the past too, such type of mischievous acts by SP leaders had come to fore.

The truth is that without the backing of the government, such businesses cannot be carried out.

In Kushinagar, the government says the liquor could have originated in Bihar - where ironically there is total prohibition.""If early treatment was taken then the death toll would be much lesser.

""India today needs somebody who believes in teamwork, collaboration and cooperation as opposed to a centralised power centre. India today really needs someone who believes in truth rather than lies, who believes in trust and not mistrust, who believes in inclusion and not exclusion.

It should not be dismissed, neither should it be demeaned.""This amount can be used (by a farmer) to send his child to school, to buy rations, to buy water from large land-owners, and so many other things. It\'s not a small amount,"" he said.""Another way to look at it is that in 10 years, you get Rs. 60,000. It\'s not a one-time sop. It\'s a long-term relief. In terms of government expenditure, Rs. 75,000 crore becomes Rs. 7.5 lakh crore in 10 years. It\'s a fair, significant fiscal burden,"" he added.Mr Kumar said that one can always criticize a measure saying it is too little, but it has to be balanced with fiscal responsibility.""Having seen poor households, I don\'t think the sum is too small. It is a significant percentage of total income, not something that disappears in the decimal as you would tend think.""He added the criticism that the scheme leaves out a large part of urban poor out of its net was also unfair and said only 13.7 per cent of farmers were tenants even out of which, 80 per cent owned some land or the other.""So hardly anyone is left out among the agriculture farming households. The only people who are not included are the landless labour. That is only 2.6 per cent of the rural population. That has been left out because for them, there is MNREGA. That is what gives them social security,"" Mr Kumar said.""The coverage is not narrow. It covers 12 crore households - around 60 crore people. It is much bigger than any farm loan waiver would cover, which are by nature skewed or biased towards larger land-owners.""In a sharp criticism of loan waiver schemes announced by the newly-formed governments in the Hindi-heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, he said it was not the answer to agricultural distress.""Farm distress can be sorted out through true modernisation of the sector - convert farmer from mere producer of commodities to a producer of agricultural value products. The second part of solving the crisis is to connect the farmer to the market - get logistics in place.68 COMMENTS""And finally, you have to lower the cost of production in agriculture. At the moment, Indian agriculture products are higher-priced than global prices.

Only diplomats from G20 nations have been invited, sources said.Mr Gandhi is expected to present his views on a variety of issues, including the relationship with Pakistan, Sri Lanka and other neighbours, besides discussions on the idea of India from different perspectives.Representatives of over 47 countries had attended an iftaar party organised by the Congress last year.In 2017, Rahul Gandhi had met the Chinese ambassador amid a massive border standoff between the two countries. The meeting, however, drew criticism and questions were raised over its rationale.As the Congress refused to confirm or deny the meeting, the party chief took to Twitter to emphasise ""he has the right to meet the envoy"".""It is my job to be informed on critical issues,"" he tweeted.If the government believed he was wrong, it should explain why top ministers were ""availing Chinese hospitality while the border issue (Doklam) was on"", the Congress chief had said.The upcoming meeting is part of Rahul Gandhi\'s outreach programme ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.2 COMMENTSSources say diplomatic engagements between envoys and the opposition aren\'t uncommon. It is part of diplomatic practice the world over for diplomats to discuss crucial issues with opposition leaders.']"

Mr Kumar arrived at the CBI office at 11 am, an hour after former Trinamool Congress leader Kunal Ghosh, another accused in the chit fund scam, arrived.On Sunday, the probe agency confronted Mr Kumar with Mr Ghosh for five hours in connection with the Saradha chit fund and Rose Valley scams.The former Trinamool Congress MP was arrested in 2013 in the Saradha scam and has been out on bail since 2016.The Kolkata Police chief, who is accused of destroying evidence related to chit fund scam, was also questioned in the Rose Valley case on Sunday.Mr Kumar led the special investigation team (SIT) formed by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to probe the Saradha scam before the case was handed over to the CBI by the supreme court.Quoting officials in Delhi, news agency PTI said the CBI has not agreedto Mr Kumar\'s demand to have his questioning session videographed, citing that the procedure is allowed only in cases of custodial interrogations.Mr Ghosh earlier implicated BJP leader Mukul Roy, who was once the right hand man of Ms Banerjee, and 12 others in the Saradha scam.The CBI is relying on a 91-page letter from Mr Ghosh, who was expelled by Trinamool, to the Enforcement Directorate, detailing the role of Rajeev Kumar in handling the investigations in the chit fund scam.The Supreme Court had fixed Shillong as the venue for his interrogation, saying that its ""neutral"" status will prevent unnecessary controversy.The CBI moved the Supreme Court after its officials were stopped by the Kolkata Police when they had gone to Mr Kumar\'s official residence in Kolkata to question him on February 3.

Priyanka Gandhi, along with her brother and Congress president Rahul Gandhi and fellow UP in-charge Jyotiraditya Scindia waved at hundreds of supporters from the top of a modified truck that was decorated in party colours.As low-hanging electricity wires in the congested city forced the Gandhi siblings to switch to an SUV, they sat cross-legged on its roof and resumed their journey. They also stopped for hot tea and little chats on the way; near a decades-old cinema theatre Congress workers surrounded their car.47-year-old Priyanka, no stranger to roadshows with her brother, is campaigning for the first time outside the Gandhi family constituencies of Amethi and Raebareli. For the first time in decades, the party managed to generate a buzz in UP, that too in its capital, which has voted the BJP in every election since 1991.""Priyanka and Scindia-ji will work for the Lok Sabha election but their mission goes beyond that to the assembly polls. We will not relent until we establish a Congress government in UP,"" said Rahul Gandhi in course of the roadshow, stressing that his party was in UP for the long-haul. He threw in his oft-repeated ""Chowkidar chor hai"", targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on corruption. The chant, picked up by the workers, followed them for much of the journey.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has a striking resemblance to Indira GandhiPriyanka, dressed in a light green kurta-churidar, folded her hands or flashed a thumbs up sign as supporters, accompanied by drummers, cheered and shouted slogans. Among the kaleidoscope of posters and billboards lining the roads were those featuring her grandmother Indira Gandhi, playing on her striking resemblance to the former prime minister.As she campaigned in UP, her husband Robert Vadra travelled with his mother Maureen Vadra to Jaipur for questioning by the Enforcement Directorate tomorrow in a money laundering case. Last week, Priyanka, taking her first big stand after joining politics, expressed support for her husband. Today, Robert Vadra posted his wishes on social media, saying ""we hand her over to the people of India. Please keep her safe.""The Congress hopes Priyanka\'s entry into politics will improve its chances in Uttar Pradesh, the state which has the highest number of seats in parliament and which the BJP swept in the 2014 national election, winning 73 of 80 seats. Her older brother announced her political debut as the party\'s general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. Jyotiraditya Scindia will be in charge of the other half of the state.""...I hope that we can all come together to bring about a new kind of politics. A kind of politics in which all of you will be stakeholders,"" Priyanka said in an audio message through the party\'s Shakti App on Sunday.The Congress has put up thousands of posters for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\'s roadshow in LucknowThe roadshow took a 20 km route through some of the most congested areas of the city.Over the next three to four days, Priyanka Gandhi is likely to frequent the party office and chair daily meetings on specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats that she is in charge of. Congress sources say after Lucknow, she may tour eastern Uttar Pradesh before returning to Delhi.Priyanka Gandhi is pitched as a big draw with her charisma and voter connect, but her Congress rescue mission remains a colossal challenge in the state where the party is of little relevance but for a ""vote-cutting"" impact on other parties.The party flopped miserably in its last two poll outings, in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections. Its candidates managed only about 19,000 votes each and a 2 per cent vote share in each constituency.In 2014, the Congress just managed to retain the Gandhi family constituencies of Amethi and Raebareli - as compared to the 21 it had won five years earlier. The party\'s vote share also dropped by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2014.Sources say the party decided on Priyanka Gandhi\'s role after much thought.82 COMMENTSEastern UP is home to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Varanasi constituency and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\'s base Gorakhpur. In the past, Allahabad (or Prayagraj, as it is called now) was Lal Bahadur Shastri\'s Lok Sabha seat and home to the Nehru family.

Mr Pilot said that the Indian electorate is sophisticated and sometimes politicians misread and underestimate the competence of voters.""As many as 130 crore people have been watching for the last four years and have been asking questions and getting no answers. It won\'t be surprising if the mighty BJP has a fantastic fall,"" he said.Mr Pilot said that BJP talks of nationalism, mandir-masjid, ghar wapsi and love jihad, but is silent on issues, including food prices and national security.He also said that never before had various institutions in the country been \'\'devalued\'\' like under the BJP.""There is a deliberate and conscious effort in the last four years to devalue institutions. It will have far reaching consequences,"" he added.Asked if Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry into politics would be a game changer, Mr Pilot said that even before she officially took charge, there was a sense of insecurity in BJP.""She is just the general secretary of the Congress, not a Chief Minister or Governor. Why is it causing so much heartburn for the BJP?

A kind of politics in which the voice of my youth friends, my sisters and the poorest of the poor will be heard,"" she told supporters through the party\'s Shakti App on Sunday.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visit. From Lucknow airport, all three leaders will proceed to the city\'s Congress office in a roadshow running well over 30 kilometres through some of the most congested areas of the city - garlanding statues of Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar along the way. Congress leaders and workers will gather to welcome her and the others at 14 different points on the route, and party workers from neighbouring districts have been called in to ensure good public presence.After reaching the Congress office, Priyanka Gandhi and the other leaders are expected to address a press conference and inaugurate a new media centre.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visitOver the next three to four days, she is likely to frequent the party office and chair daily meetings on specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats that fall under her purview. Congress sources say that once Priyanka Gandhi is done with Lucknow, she may embark on a tour of eastern Uttar Pradesh instead of returning to DelhiBut while the Congress believes that Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry will boost its prospects in the Lok Sabha elections, with her charisma and voter connect being touted as the major draws, a reality check suggests that it could still be a daunting task. The last two Lok Sabha elections in eastern UP - the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls of 2018 - turned out to be disastrous for the party. On both seats, its candidates managed only about 19,000 votes each and a 2% vote share in each constituency.The 2014 Lok Sabha polls was just as tragic for the Congress, bagging just two seats - Amethi and Raebareli - as compared to the 21 it had won five years earlier. The party\'s vote share also dropped by almost 50% between 2009 and 2014. So, the question is: Does Priyanka Gandhi have the time to revive the party\'s seemingly defunct grassroots organisation?Sources say the party decided on Priyanka Gandhi\'s foray into eastern Uttar Pradesh after much thought, and the leadership believes that reviving it in eastern Uttar Pradesh would amount to achieving a symbolic victory.75 COMMENTSAllahabad (or Prayagraj, as it is called now) was Lal Bahadur Shastri\'s Lok Sabha seat and home to the Nehru family. Neighbouring Phulpur was Jawaharlal Nehru\'s Lok Sabha seat. East Uttar Pradesh also has the strongholds of both Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a good showing in a direct fight can boost the party\'s morale immensely. Failure is a possibility too, but that\'s a chance Priyanka Gandhi and her brother are willing to take.']"

India today really needs someone who believes in truth rather than lies, who believes in trust and not mistrust, who believes in inclusion and not exclusion.

She will join him in getting young people excited, especially women. They are both young, they represent a large young team in the party, they are modern, they are tech-savvy with a healthy respect for history and new vision for the future.""I am confident that they will attract more young people in the mainstream and that is what a young India needs,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who divides his time between the US and India, is seen as a key adviser of the Gandhis.Asked if the Rahul-Priyanka team will be a game changer for the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls, expected in April-May, he said: ""I think it will be. People will see the benefit of a younger team with a modern outlook. The country needs to look forward rather than backwards, and not get hung up on history and religion.""""But it is not just the Rahul-Priyanka combine.

He as well as Mr Deora, 42, and Mr Scindia had served as Union ministers in the last UPA government at the centre.Rahul Gandhi, 48, took charge as Congress chief in December 2017.However, the Congress party has had several presidents who took charge at a younger age, including his father Rajiv Gandhi, grandmother Indira Gandhi, and maternal great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru, as also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.On the BJP\'s charge that the Congress was promoting dynastic politics, Mr Pitroda said dynasty is in every business, but ultimately it is the performance that matters. If you do not perform dynasty cannot help, he said.Rahul Gandhi\'s popularity has increased exponentially after becoming Congress president because once he took over the party, he has had a free hand, Mr Pitroda said.""He could do things that he wanted to do. Earlier, he was constrained in some ways. After becoming Congress president, he had to leave his mark, bring in a young team, respect the old guards, and realise that going forward, he would need new thinking and new blood, and that is what he is trying to do,"" said Mr Pitroda, who headed the Knowledge Commission during the tenure of Manmohan Singh.He said Gandhi has the qualities to make a good prime minister because his heart is in the right place and he is keen on working for the greater good of India and its people.""He (Gandhi) is not driven by personal and vested interests. He is driven by the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid. He is driven by opportunities for the young. He is driven by the welfare of farmers. He is driven by the idea of inclusion...he believes in the idea of India that our founding fathers had,"" Mr Pitroda said.To a question on whether Rahul Gandhi\'s NRI events in foreign countries were similar to the ones Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had during his overseas visits, he said it was not so and the idea behind the trips was not just to have big events with NRIs, but to meet local political and business leaders, interact with students, interact with members of the Indian Overseas Congress, NRIs, and then have a big event to be able to meet them en masse.""He (Gandhi) interacts with students wherever he goes, so it is a different format,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who has worked closely with both Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, said they cannot be compared as there is big difference between the India 35 years back and the India now, but added that both were very open to new ideas.4 COMMENTSMr Pitroda led the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi when he set up the C-DOT.

It should not be dismissed, neither should it be demeaned.""This amount can be used (by a farmer) to send his child to school, to buy rations, to buy water from large land-owners, and so many other things. It\'s not a small amount,"" he said.""Another way to look at it is that in 10 years, you get Rs. 60,000. It\'s not a one-time sop. It\'s a long-term relief.

It is a significant percentage of total income, not something that disappears in the decimal as you would tend think.""He added the criticism that the scheme leaves out a large part of urban poor out of its net was also unfair and said only 13.7 per cent of farmers were tenants even out of which, 80 per cent owned some land or the other.""So hardly anyone is left out among the agriculture farming households. The only people who are not included are the landless labour. That is only 2.6 per cent of the rural population. That has been left out because for them, there is MNREGA. That is what gives them social security,"" Mr Kumar said.""The coverage is not narrow. It covers 12 crore households - around 60 crore people. It is much bigger than any farm loan waiver would cover, which are by nature skewed or biased towards larger land-owners.""In a sharp criticism of loan waiver schemes announced by the newly-formed governments in the Hindi-heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, he said it was not the answer to agricultural distress.""Farm distress can be sorted out through true modernisation of the sector - convert farmer from mere producer of commodities to a producer of agricultural value products. The second part of solving the crisis is to connect the farmer to the market - get logistics in place.68 COMMENTS""And finally, you have to lower the cost of production in agriculture.

"['Chennai:Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Monday hit back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for apparently calling him ""recounting minister"", insisting that there was no re-count of votes in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls as was being said.P Chidambaram wondered ""how many times can people in high places peddle a lie"".""In the 2009 elections, in Sivaganga constituency, there was only one count and no re-count. A simple check with the Returning Officer would have confirmed that there was no re-count. How many times can people in high places peddle a lie?"" Mr Chidambaram said in a tweet.The former Union minister\'s response came a day after PM Modi taunted him as ""recounting minister"" of the UPA regime, during his public meeting at Tirupur on Sunday.Citing his government\'s step of offering tax exemption for those with income of up to Rs. 5 lakh, PM Modi had said that it was a reflection of genuine concern for the middle class, unlike the previous UPA regime.Referring to this, PM Modi had said he wanted to recall the state of affairs during the UPA regime.""There was a very wise minister from Tamil Nadu,"" he said and told the audience ""you know whom I am talking about"".When the people responded loudly, he said, ""right, the recounting minister"", without naming the former Union Finance Minister.P Chidambaram, now a Rajya Sabha MP, won the 2009 Lok Sabha election from Sivaganga constituency in Tamil Nadu by a slender margin of 3,354 votes after a see-saw battle.Confusion had prevailed then as election officials delayed the declaration of the result due to a dispute in the counting of votes in respect of the final round.P Chidambaram, then Home Minister, was declared elected after the votes were tallied again vis-a-vis the final round.3 COMMENTSPM Modi had made the same ""recounting minister"" remark during his 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign as well.']"

On Sunday, PM Modi had at a rally in Andhra Pradesh accused Mr Naidu of wasting public money on political campaigns.Rahul Gandhi was among the opposition leaders who arrived at Andhra Bhawan to express solidarity with the Chief Minister\'s protest. ""The PM doesn\'t fulfill commitments to the people of Andhra Pradesh. Is Andhra Pradesh not a part of the country? I stand with the people of Andhra,"" he said.On Sunday, PM Modi had at a rally in Andhra Pradesh accused N Chandrababu Naidu of wasting public money on political campaigns""Mr Modi, wherever he goes, he lies. He goes to Andhra, he lies, he goes to the Northeast, he lies,"" the Congress president added.The Hindu newspaper has reported that provisions for anti-corruption penalties and an escrow account for payments were dropped days before the Rafale deal was signed, in what it calls ""major and unprecedented concessions"" from a government that has repeatedly stressed on fighting corruption in defence deals.The newspaper had earlier reported on defence ministry objections to ""parallel negotiations"" conducted by the Prime Minister\'s Office.The Congress alleges that the government finalised an overpriced deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets at an inflated price to benefit Anil Ambani, whose inexperienced defence firm was recommended as an offset partner for Dassault, the company manufacturing the aircraft. Both Dassault and the government have denied the allegations.17 COMMENTSDisclaimer: NDTV has been sued for 10,000 crores by Anil Ambani\'s Reliance Group for its coverage of the Rafale deal']"
"['Priyanka Gandhi In Lucknow: A smiling Priyanka Gandhi Vadra kicked off her Lucknow roadshowNew Delhi:Priyanka Gandhi Vadra reached Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow this morning and kicked off a rally accompanied by her brother Congress President Rahul Gandhi and senior party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, seen as the Congress\' big hope for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, announced her entry into politics as the party\'s general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. Reviving Congress fortunes in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh will be a symbolic victory for the party as Allahabad has been home to the Nehru family and was also former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Sastri\'s Lok Sabha seat. Neighbouring Phulpur used to be India\'s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru\'s Lok Sabha seat.The last two Lok Sabha elections in eastern Uttar Pradesh, for the Gorakhpur and Phulpur constituencies, were disastrous for the Congress. Congress candidates managed to fetch only around 19,000 votes each and registered only a 2% vote share in each constituency.Eastern Uttar Pradesh currently has strongholds of both Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.A 30-kilometre long roadshow is planned in Lucknow as a grand welcome for the top three Congress leaders, through some of the most congested areas of the city.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will, in the course of the next three days, conduct daily meetings over specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats which fall under her purview. Sources say instead of returning to Delhi after her Lucknow visit, she may tour eastern Uttar Pradesh.Here are the Highlightson Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\'s Lucknow Roadshow:Feb 11, 201920:35 (IST)--> Visuals of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress\' new general secretary meeting her young fans during roadshow today.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-in-uttar-pradesh-live-updates-priyanka-gandhi-to-kick-off-congress-rally-in-lucknow-1991406?q_id=34"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Feb 11, 201919:35 (IST)-->Congress President Rahul Gandhi, senior party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra drink chai during their roadshow in UP.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-in-uttar-pradesh-live-updates-priyanka-gandhi-to-kick-off-congress-rally-in-lucknow-1991406?q_id=33"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Feb 11, 201917:57 (IST)-->""Congress cannot remain weak in UP"", says Rahul GandhiCongress cannot remain weak in Uttar Pradesh.

Rahul Gandhi, brother and Congress president, had announced her entry into politics as the party\'s general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. Priyanka Gandhi will be accompanied by Jyotiraditya Scindia, the party\'s western Uttar Pradesh in-charge, and the Congress chief on the occasion.""Tomorrow, I hope that we can all come together to bring about a new kind of politics. A kind of politics in which all of you will be stakeholders. A kind of politics in which the voice of my youth friends, my sisters and the poorest of the poor will be heard,"" she told supporters through the party\'s Shakti App on Sunday.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visit. From Lucknow airport, all three leaders will proceed to the city\'s Congress office in a roadshow running well over 30 kilometres through some of the most congested areas of the city - garlanding statues of Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar along the way. Congress leaders and workers will gather to welcome her and the others at 14 different points on the route, and party workers from neighbouring districts have been called in to ensure good public presence.After reaching the Congress office, Priyanka Gandhi and the other leaders are expected to address a press conference and inaugurate a new media centre.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visitOver the next three to four days, she is likely to frequent the party office and chair daily meetings on specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats that fall under her purview. Congress sources say that once Priyanka Gandhi is done with Lucknow, she may embark on a tour of eastern Uttar Pradesh instead of returning to DelhiBut while the Congress believes that Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry will boost its prospects in the Lok Sabha elections, with her charisma and voter connect being touted as the major draws, a reality check suggests that it could still be a daunting task. The last two Lok Sabha elections in eastern UP - the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls of 2018 - turned out to be disastrous for the party. On both seats, its candidates managed only about 19,000 votes each and a 2% vote share in each constituency.The 2014 Lok Sabha polls was just as tragic for the Congress, bagging just two seats - Amethi and Raebareli - as compared to the 21 it had won five years earlier. The party\'s vote share also dropped by almost 50% between 2009 and 2014. So, the question is: Does Priyanka Gandhi have the time to revive the party\'s seemingly defunct grassroots organisation?Sources say the party decided on Priyanka Gandhi\'s foray into eastern Uttar Pradesh after much thought, and the leadership believes that reviving it in eastern Uttar Pradesh would amount to achieving a symbolic victory.75 COMMENTSAllahabad (or Prayagraj, as it is called now) was Lal Bahadur Shastri\'s Lok Sabha seat and home to the Nehru family. Neighbouring Phulpur was Jawaharlal Nehru\'s Lok Sabha seat. East Uttar Pradesh also has the strongholds of both Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a good showing in a direct fight can boost the party\'s morale immensely. Failure is a possibility too, but that\'s a chance Priyanka Gandhi and her brother are willing to take.']"
"['New Delhi:Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will complement Congress president Rahul Gandhi\'s efforts in winning over young voters and the brother-sister combine will be a game changer for the party in the Lok Sabha polls as the country needs a young team, technocrat-turned-politician Sam Pitroda said on Sunday.He said the Rahul Gandhi-Priyanka Gandhi Vadra duo will make a ""great team"" along with many other young leaders active in the party, including Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Milind Deora, as people who can take the country forward, rather than keeping it hung up on history and religion.Mr Pitroda, the Indian Overseas Congress chief and a long-time friend of the Gandhi family, also said Rahul Gandhi has learnt a lot from the 2014 elections and is much more ""mature, stronger, wiser"", and ready to take on the job of Prime Minister.In an interview with PTI from Chicago, he said India needs a young person with a new inclusive vision of the future, focus on employment, and new opportunities for all, to lead.""India today needs somebody who believes in teamwork, collaboration and cooperation as opposed to a centralised power centre. India today really needs someone who believes in truth rather than lies, who believes in trust and not mistrust, who believes in inclusion and not exclusion. Rahul is at the right age to lead India,"" Mr Pitroda said.Asked about Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry into active politics as AICC general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh East, he said she will be a ""great asset and a good politician"".""She will complement her brother\'s efforts. She will join him in getting young people excited, especially women. They are both young, they represent a large young team in the party, they are modern, they are tech-savvy with a healthy respect for history and new vision for the future.""I am confident that they will attract more young people in the mainstream and that is what a young India needs,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who divides his time between the US and India, is seen as a key adviser of the Gandhis.Asked if the Rahul-Priyanka team will be a game changer for the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls, expected in April-May, he said: ""I think it will be. People will see the benefit of a younger team with a modern outlook. The country needs to look forward rather than backwards, and not get hung up on history and religion.""""But it is not just the Rahul-Priyanka combine. The party has many other young people like Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Milind Deora, to name just a few,"" he said.Mr Pitroda said he is hopeful that Priyanka Gandhi\'s coming into active politics will have a big impact on the polls.Priyanka Gandhi, 47, and Mr Scindia, 48, took charge as AICC general secretary UP east and UP west respectively last week. Mr Pilot, 41, was made deputy chief minister of Rajasthan in December 2018 after the Congress wrested power from BJP. He as well as Mr Deora, 42, and Mr Scindia had served as Union ministers in the last UPA government at the centre.Rahul Gandhi, 48, took charge as Congress chief in December 2017.However, the Congress party has had several presidents who took charge at a younger age, including his father Rajiv Gandhi, grandmother Indira Gandhi, and maternal great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru, as also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.On the BJP\'s charge that the Congress was promoting dynastic politics, Mr Pitroda said dynasty is in every business, but ultimately it is the performance that matters. If you do not perform dynasty cannot help, he said.Rahul Gandhi\'s popularity has increased exponentially after becoming Congress president because once he took over the party, he has had a free hand, Mr Pitroda said.""He could do things that he wanted to do. Earlier, he was constrained in some ways. After becoming Congress president, he had to leave his mark, bring in a young team, respect the old guards, and realise that going forward, he would need new thinking and new blood, and that is what he is trying to do,"" said Mr Pitroda, who headed the Knowledge Commission during the tenure of Manmohan Singh.He said Gandhi has the qualities to make a good prime minister because his heart is in the right place and he is keen on working for the greater good of India and its people.""He (Gandhi) is not driven by personal and vested interests. He is driven by the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid. He is driven by opportunities for the young. He is driven by the welfare of farmers. He is driven by the idea of inclusion...he believes in the idea of India that our founding fathers had,"" Mr Pitroda said.To a question on whether Rahul Gandhi\'s NRI events in foreign countries were similar to the ones Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had during his overseas visits, he said it was not so and the idea behind the trips was not just to have big events with NRIs, but to meet local political and business leaders, interact with students, interact with members of the Indian Overseas Congress, NRIs, and then have a big event to be able to meet them en masse.""He (Gandhi) interacts with students wherever he goes, so it is a different format,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who has worked closely with both Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, said they cannot be compared as there is big difference between the India 35 years back and the India now, but added that both were very open to new ideas.4 COMMENTSMr Pitroda led the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi when he set up the C-DOT. He worked on the Knowledge Commission and also founded National Innovation Council later during the Congress-led UPA rule.']"

What has been the corruption record of Indiraji (former prime minister), his grandmother? We have never used the kind of language he has used against Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" the Law Minister said.The Congress-led UPA government couldn\'t close the Rafale deal as it didn\'t see any benefits and ignored the Indian Air Force\'s urgent needs, Mr Prasad alleged.""As they did not get commission, therefore they kept it (deal) pending,"" he alleged.The basic price of the Rafale fighter negotiated by the centre is cheaper than what the UPA had agreed to, the BJP leader reiterated.The UPA government was negotiating with Dassault Aviation, that manufactures Rafale fighters, for 126 jets, of which 18 jets were to supplied in a ready-to-fly condition and 108 were to be manufactured in India by the French company along with the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).

In 2013, Mr Gandhi trashed the ordinance as ""nonsense"" and it was withdrawn by the cabinet.Mr Krishna further said the reason for the alleged scams during the Congress rule was coalition politics.""In my second tenure during UPA, I was minister for External Affairs. I was also part of the cabinet joint responsibility framework. It was not a conducive environment for governance.

And in that context, an additional Rs 500 does not sound so little. It should not be dismissed, neither should it be demeaned.""This amount can be used (by a farmer) to send his child to school, to buy rations, to buy water from large land-owners, and so many other things. It\'s not a small amount,"" he said.""Another way to look at it is that in 10 years, you get Rs 60,000. It\'s not a one-time sop. It\'s a long-term relief. In terms of government expenditure, Rs 75,000 crore becomes Rs 7.5 lakh crore in 10 years. It\'s a fair, significant fiscal burden,"" he added.Mr Kumar said that one can always criticize a measure saying it is too little, but it has to be balanced with fiscal responsibility.""Having seen poor households, I don\'t think the sum is too small. It is a significant percentage of total income, not something that disappears in the decimal as you would tend think.""He added the criticism that the scheme leaves out a large part of urban poor out of its net was also unfair and said only 13.7 per cent of farmers were tenants even out of which, 80 per cent owned some land or the other.""So hardly anyone is left out among the agriculture farming households. The only people who are not included are the landless labour. That is only 2.6 per cent of the rural population. That has been left out because for them, there is MNREGA. That is what gives them social security,"" Mr Kumar said.""The coverage is not narrow. It covers 12 crore households - around 60 crore people. It is much bigger than any farm loan waiver would cover, which are by nature skewed or biased towards larger land-owners.""In a sharp criticism of loan waiver schemes announced by the newly-formed governments in the Hindi-heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, he said it was not the answer to agricultural distress.""Farm distress can be sorted out through true modernisation of the sector - convert farmer from mere producer of commodities to a producer of agricultural value products. The second part of solving the crisis is to connect the farmer to the market - get logistics in place.68 COMMENTS""And finally, you have to lower the cost of production in agriculture. At the moment, Indian agriculture products are higher-priced than global prices. There I think, one has to move away from the model of increasing doses of chemical inputs into agriculture, resulting in higher cost, higher debt and higher distress. We need to shift to bio pesticides, bio-fertilizers,"" Mr Kumar said.']"

The Rajasthan High Court has directed him to cooperate with the agency in the case.The agency had registered a money laundering case in September 2015 alleging that Skylight Hospitality had acquired land in Kolayat village of Bikaner, which was meant for rehabilitation of poor villagers. It was alleged that Vadra bought 69.55 hectares of land at a cheaper rate and sold it to Allegheny Finlease for Rs. 5.15 crore through illegal transactions.During investigations, the agency claimed to have found Allengenery had no real business dealings and the shareholders were also found to be fake.Earlier, the CBI had also filed 18 cases at the instance of the Rajasthan government in August 2017 in connection with the Bikaner land deal case.Of the 18, four cases have been registered against Skylight Hospitality.According to ED sources, Mr Vadra will also be called for questioning in a money laundering case relating to a land deak in Gurugram\'s Shikohpur village after it registers a fresh case in the coming days.On January 23, the CBI had filed a case against former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and several others, including 15 private builders, for alleged irregularities in allotting over 1,417 acres of land during 2009-12 in Gurugram.The Haryana Police on September 2 last year has also registered a case against Mr Vadra and Hooda for alleged irregularities in land deals in Gurugram. Mr Vadra faces allegations that his company sold 3.5 acres of land in 2008 in Shikohpur village to DLF at a rate much higher than was prevailing at the time.The ED has also grilled Mr Vadra for in a money laundering case against his close aide Manoj Arora, whose role surfaced during a probe by the Income Tax Department into another case under against absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari.The London property was allegedly bought by Mr Bhandari and sold in 2010 for the same amount despite incurring additional expenses on its renovation.The ED says it has received information about various new properties in London which belong to Mr Vadra. These include two houses, one worth 5 million pounds and the other valued at 4 million pounds and six flats. The total worth of these properties is 12 million pounds.The ED also grilled Mr Vadra about the mails he exchanged with Sumit Chadha, a relative of Mr Bhandari, in reference to a London property. Mr Vadra was also asked how he knew Mr Bhandari and Mr Chadha and what business transactions they had.According to sources, Mr Vadra was confronted with the emails he had reportedly exchanged with Mr Chadha for the payment of the renovation of a London property, about which the agency informed a Delhi court.The ED also told the court that the London property was part of the kickbacks received in a petroleum deal.According to the ED, Mr Vadra and his associates received \'kickbacks\' in the petroleum deal signed in 2009 during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime.3 COMMENTSThe ED claimed that money was allegedly transferred to Santech International, FZC, a company based in UAE and controlled by Mr Bhandari.

Mr Vadra, the husband of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, wasgrilled for over 24 hours altogether for three days last week in another alleged money laundering case on purchase of a property in the UK worth 1.9 million pounds (approximately Rs. 17 crore).Investigators have accused Mr Vadra of letting the personal driver of an associate, Mahesh Nagar, pay for buying land in Rajasthan\'s Bikaner with a cheque drawn on behalf of his mother Maureen, and have questioned the manner in which the transaction was done.The mother-son duo, who landed in Jaipur on Monday afternoon, is expected to visit the probe agency\'s office on Bhawani Singh Road at 10 am on Tuesday.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also reached Jaipur late on Monday after wrapping up her mega roadshow in Lucknow.She is likely to drop off her husband and mother-in-law at the probe agency\'s office this morning. On the first day of Mr Vadra questioning in Delhi last week, Priyanka Gandhi had accompanied him to the ED\'s office as she wanted to send a ""clear message"" with her appearance. ""I stand by my husband,"" she had told NDTV.Last month, the businessman and his mother were told by the Rajasthan High Court to appear before the Enforcement Directorate for recording their statements, after they asked the court to ensure the probe agency refrain from taking any coercive action against them. Mr Vadra went to the court after he got at least three summons from the probe agency, according to news agency PTI.The Enforcement Directorate filed a money laundering case in 2015 after it took note of several First Information Reports (FIRs) filed by the Rajasthan Police, which received complaints from the Bikaner tehsildar on alleged forgery in land allotment in the area, considered sensitive due to its proximity to the border with Pakistan.In his complaint, the tehsildar said government land in 34 villages of Bikaner to be used for expanding the Army\'s firing range was ""grabbed"" by the land mafia with the help of ""forged and fabricated documents"", with the help of some government officials. The ED suspects a huge amount of money was laundered as people bought land at cheap rates through forged documents.The probe agency wants to question Mr Vadra about the operations of a firm, Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd, allegedly linked to him, which had bought land in Bikaner. The ED is likely to confront Mr Vadra with the statements of people who were aware of the transactions, PTI reported.The role of a big steel company that gave loans to another firm, which eventually bought the land from companies linked to Mr Vadra at an inflated price, will be investigated, officials in the probe team said.27 COMMENTSMr Vadra has denied any wrongdoing in the Bikaner case, and accused the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of going down the path of vendetta politics, more so at a time when his wife Priyanka Gandhi has been made the Congress\'s Lok Sabha election campaign in-charge in eastern Uttar Pradesh where the constituencies of PM Modi and the saffron-robed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minster Yogi Adityanath are located.']"

Sources say instead of returning to Delhi after her Lucknow visit, she may tour eastern Uttar Pradesh.Here are the Highlightson Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\'s Lucknow Roadshow:Feb 11, 201920:35 (IST)--> Visuals of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress\' new general secretary meeting her young fans during roadshow today.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-in-uttar-pradesh-live-updates-priyanka-gandhi-to-kick-off-congress-rally-in-lucknow-1991406?q_id=34"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Feb 11, 201919:35 (IST)-->Congress President Rahul Gandhi, senior party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra drink chai during their roadshow in UP.\n                                        var url = ""https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-in-uttar-pradesh-live-updates-priyanka-gandhi-to-kick-off-congress-rally-in-lucknow-1991406?q_id=33"";\n                                        //shr_f(url);\n                                        Feb 11, 201917:57 (IST)-->""Congress cannot remain weak in UP"", says Rahul GandhiCongress cannot remain weak in Uttar Pradesh.

Rahul Gandhi, brother and Congress president, had announced her entry into politics as the party\'s general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. Priyanka Gandhi will be accompanied by Jyotiraditya Scindia, the party\'s western Uttar Pradesh in-charge, and the Congress chief on the occasion.""Tomorrow, I hope that we can all come together to bring about a new kind of politics. A kind of politics in which all of you will be stakeholders. A kind of politics in which the voice of my youth friends, my sisters and the poorest of the poor will be heard,"" she told supporters through the party\'s Shakti App on Sunday.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visit. From Lucknow airport, all three leaders will proceed to the city\'s Congress office in a roadshow running well over 30 kilometres through some of the most congested areas of the city - garlanding statues of Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar along the way. Congress leaders and workers will gather to welcome her and the others at 14 different points on the route, and party workers from neighbouring districts have been called in to ensure good public presence.After reaching the Congress office, Priyanka Gandhi and the other leaders are expected to address a press conference and inaugurate a new media centre.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visitOver the next three to four days, she is likely to frequent the party office and chair daily meetings on specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats that fall under her purview. Congress sources say that once Priyanka Gandhi is done with Lucknow, she may embark on a tour of eastern Uttar Pradesh instead of returning to DelhiBut while the Congress believes that Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry will boost its prospects in the Lok Sabha elections, with her charisma and voter connect being touted as the major draws, a reality check suggests that it could still be a daunting task. The last two Lok Sabha elections in eastern UP - the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls of 2018 - turned out to be disastrous for the party. On both seats, its candidates managed only about 19,000 votes each and a 2% vote share in each constituency.The 2014 Lok Sabha polls was just as tragic for the Congress, bagging just two seats - Amethi and Raebareli - as compared to the 21 it had won five years earlier. The party\'s vote share also dropped by almost 50% between 2009 and 2014. So, the question is: Does Priyanka Gandhi have the time to revive the party\'s seemingly defunct grassroots organisation?Sources say the party decided on Priyanka Gandhi\'s foray into eastern Uttar Pradesh after much thought, and the leadership believes that reviving it in eastern Uttar Pradesh would amount to achieving a symbolic victory.75 COMMENTSAllahabad (or Prayagraj, as it is called now) was Lal Bahadur Shastri\'s Lok Sabha seat and home to the Nehru family. Neighbouring Phulpur was Jawaharlal Nehru\'s Lok Sabha seat. East Uttar Pradesh also has the strongholds of both Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a good showing in a direct fight can boost the party\'s morale immensely. Failure is a possibility too, but that\'s a chance Priyanka Gandhi and her brother are willing to take.']"
"['New Delhi:Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will complement Congress president Rahul Gandhi\'s efforts in winning over young voters and the brother-sister combine will be a game changer for the party in the Lok Sabha polls as the country needs a young team, technocrat-turned-politician Sam Pitroda said on Sunday.He said the Rahul Gandhi-Priyanka Gandhi Vadra duo will make a ""great team"" along with many other young leaders active in the party, including Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Milind Deora, as people who can take the country forward, rather than keeping it hung up on history and religion.Mr Pitroda, the Indian Overseas Congress chief and a long-time friend of the Gandhi family, also said Rahul Gandhi has learnt a lot from the 2014 elections and is much more ""mature, stronger, wiser"", and ready to take on the job of Prime Minister.In an interview with PTI from Chicago, he said India needs a young person with a new inclusive vision of the future, focus on employment, and new opportunities for all, to lead.""India today needs somebody who believes in teamwork, collaboration and cooperation as opposed to a centralised power centre. India today really needs someone who believes in truth rather than lies, who believes in trust and not mistrust, who believes in inclusion and not exclusion. Rahul is at the right age to lead India,"" Mr Pitroda said.Asked about Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry into active politics as AICC general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh East, he said she will be a ""great asset and a good politician"".""She will complement her brother\'s efforts. She will join him in getting young people excited, especially women. They are both young, they represent a large young team in the party, they are modern, they are tech-savvy with a healthy respect for history and new vision for the future.""I am confident that they will attract more young people in the mainstream and that is what a young India needs,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who divides his time between the US and India, is seen as a key adviser of the Gandhis.Asked if the Rahul-Priyanka team will be a game changer for the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls, expected in April-May, he said: ""I think it will be. People will see the benefit of a younger team with a modern outlook. The country needs to look forward rather than backwards, and not get hung up on history and religion.""""But it is not just the Rahul-Priyanka combine. The party has many other young people like Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Milind Deora, to name just a few,"" he said.Mr Pitroda said he is hopeful that Priyanka Gandhi\'s coming into active politics will have a big impact on the polls.Priyanka Gandhi, 47, and Mr Scindia, 48, took charge as AICC general secretary UP east and UP west respectively last week. Mr Pilot, 41, was made deputy chief minister of Rajasthan in December 2018 after the Congress wrested power from BJP. He as well as Mr Deora, 42, and Mr Scindia had served as Union ministers in the last UPA government at the centre.Rahul Gandhi, 48, took charge as Congress chief in December 2017.However, the Congress party has had several presidents who took charge at a younger age, including his father Rajiv Gandhi, grandmother Indira Gandhi, and maternal great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru, as also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.On the BJP\'s charge that the Congress was promoting dynastic politics, Mr Pitroda said dynasty is in every business, but ultimately it is the performance that matters. If you do not perform dynasty cannot help, he said.Rahul Gandhi\'s popularity has increased exponentially after becoming Congress president because once he took over the party, he has had a free hand, Mr Pitroda said.""He could do things that he wanted to do. Earlier, he was constrained in some ways. After becoming Congress president, he had to leave his mark, bring in a young team, respect the old guards, and realise that going forward, he would need new thinking and new blood, and that is what he is trying to do,"" said Mr Pitroda, who headed the Knowledge Commission during the tenure of Manmohan Singh.He said Gandhi has the qualities to make a good prime minister because his heart is in the right place and he is keen on working for the greater good of India and its people.""He (Gandhi) is not driven by personal and vested interests. He is driven by the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid. He is driven by opportunities for the young. He is driven by the welfare of farmers. He is driven by the idea of inclusion...he believes in the idea of India that our founding fathers had,"" Mr Pitroda said.To a question on whether Rahul Gandhi\'s NRI events in foreign countries were similar to the ones Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had during his overseas visits, he said it was not so and the idea behind the trips was not just to have big events with NRIs, but to meet local political and business leaders, interact with students, interact with members of the Indian Overseas Congress, NRIs, and then have a big event to be able to meet them en masse.""He (Gandhi) interacts with students wherever he goes, so it is a different format,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who has worked closely with both Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, said they cannot be compared as there is big difference between the India 35 years back and the India now, but added that both were very open to new ideas.4 COMMENTSMr Pitroda led the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi when he set up the C-DOT. He worked on the Knowledge Commission and also founded National Innovation Council later during the Congress-led UPA rule.']"

We neither have that kind of fiscal space, nor that kind of complete data that you need were you to be able to implement it,"" Mr Kumar told IANS in an interview.""This is why, I think, the Congress has left all details completely unclear and have only made a broad announcement,"" he added.Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has, however, said that the broad contours of the scheme justifying its feasibility would be explained in the Congress manifesto.Rejecting the idea of Universal Basic Income for Indians, Mr Kumar said: ""I have not been a supporter of the scheme.

And in that context, an additional Rs. 500 does not sound so little. It should not be dismissed, neither should it be demeaned.""This amount can be used (by a farmer) to send his child to school, to buy rations, to buy water from large land-owners, and so many other things. It\'s not a small amount,"" he said.""Another way to look at it is that in 10 years, you get Rs. 60,000. It\'s not a one-time sop. It\'s a long-term relief. In terms of government expenditure, Rs. 75,000 crore becomes Rs. 7.5 lakh crore in 10 years. It\'s a fair, significant fiscal burden,"" he added.Mr Kumar said that one can always criticize a measure saying it is too little, but it has to be balanced with fiscal responsibility.""Having seen poor households, I don\'t think the sum is too small. It is a significant percentage of total income, not something that disappears in the decimal as you would tend think.""He added the criticism that the scheme leaves out a large part of urban poor out of its net was also unfair and said only 13.7 per cent of farmers were tenants even out of which, 80 per cent owned some land or the other.""So hardly anyone is left out among the agriculture farming households. The only people who are not included are the landless labour. That is only 2.6 per cent of the rural population. That has been left out because for them, there is MNREGA. That is what gives them social security,"" Mr Kumar said.""The coverage is not narrow. It covers 12 crore households - around 60 crore people.

The second part of solving the crisis is to connect the farmer to the market - get logistics in place.68 COMMENTS""And finally, you have to lower the cost of production in agriculture. At the moment, Indian agriculture products are higher-priced than global prices.

The total worth of these properties is 12 million pounds.The ED also grilled Mr Vadra about the mails he exchanged with Sumit Chadha, a relative of Mr Bhandari, in reference to a London property. Mr Vadra was also asked how he knew Mr Bhandari and Mr Chadha and what business transactions they had.According to sources, Mr Vadra was confronted with the emails he had reportedly exchanged with Mr Chadha for the payment of the renovation of a London property, about which the agency informed a Delhi court.The ED also told the court that the London property was part of the kickbacks received in a petroleum deal.According to the ED, Mr Vadra and his associates received \'kickbacks\' in the petroleum deal signed in 2009 during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime.3 COMMENTSThe ED claimed that money was allegedly transferred to Santech International, FZC, a company based in UAE and controlled by Mr Bhandari.

Moments later, stooping behind the mic and shrinking from the stage, he said, ""Today, Narendra Modi gives speeches like this."" The crowd roared at him.During the campaign for the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh in October last year, Rahul Gandhi had said in Morena, using hand gestures, ""Mitron (friends), don\'t make me prime minister, make me chowkidar.""Rahul Gandhi has also been on the receiving side of the mimicry battle.In November 2013, PM Modi who was then a BJP candidate campaigning for the 2014 national elections, had taken a swipe at Rahul Gandhi by pausing dramatically after a reference to ""Shehzada"", and pretending to roll up both his sleeves during a rally in Chhattisgarh\'s Raigarh.On Monday\'s event in Lucknow, Rahul Gandhi accompanied his sister Priyanka as her entourage cut through the crowded streets of the Uttar Pradesh capital in a show of strength that was seen as sending a message to the BJP. Priyanka is leading the Congress battle formation in eastern Uttar Pradesh, where the Lok Sabha constituency of PM Modi is located.The BJP, hoping that the Congress\'s kick in Uttar Pradesh would go wide, maintains Priyanka Gandhi is not a big threat to its chances in the heartland state where there are 80 Lok Sabha seats.58 COMMENTSDisclaimer: NDTV has been sued for 10,000 crores by Anil Ambani\'s Reliance Group for its coverage of the Rafale deal']"
"['Lucknow:Asserting that the Congress would ""play on the front foot"" in Uttar Pradesh, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said on Monday he and his party would not sit idle till it forms government in the state and that Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia had been given that mandate.During a four-and-a-half-hour roadshow that marked his sister Priyanka\'s first public event after being appointed as the party\'s general secretary in charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, the Congress president said he had told her and Mr Scindia, the general secretary in charge of western UP, their mandate was to bring a government in the state that would ensure justice for all.""Their aim is definitely the Lok Sabha elections, but also to bring a Congress government here,"" he said, taking the political challenge posed by his opponents head on.Asking the crowd to repeat his ""chowkidar chor hai"" (guard is the thief) barb against PM Narendra Modi in connection with the Congress party\'s corruption allegation in the Rafale fighter jet deal, Mr Gandhi alleged that the prime minister has ""stolen"" money from Uttar Pradesh and other states to benefit industrialist Anil Ambani.The government and Mr Ambani\'s Reliance Group have denied the allegations levelled against them by the Congress and other opposition parties.On Uttar Pradesh, where his party is struggling to regain its lost moorings, the Congress chief said, ""UP is the centre (and) heart of country. I have made Priyanka and Scindiaji general secretaries and told them that they have to fight injustice that has been rampant in the state for years. They have to fight against it and bring a government that gives justice.""Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Jyotiraditya Scindia were recently appointed by him as Congress general secretaries with charge of eastern and western UP, respectively, keeping in mind the Lok Sabha elections expected to take place in April-May.The Congress party had fared miserably in the state during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections by winning just two of 80 seats in the state.Using a cricket analogy, he said the Congress will play on the front foot and not on the back foot in the state.""Till a Congress ideology government is installed here (UP), we will not sit idle and ensure justice to the farmers, the youth, the poor,"" he said.Moving through major thoroughfares of the state capital atop a makeshift ""rath"" and braving teeming crowds, Rahul Gandhi stopped in the Lalbagh area to address bystanders.Later on reaching the state Congress headquarters, he profusely thanked his partymen for the grand show.He said that for the Congress there was no dearth of issues.""There are issues after issues for the Congress workers, talk about corruption, farmers, employment... it is only a matter of moving ahead and fighting for the Congress ideology and see what happens in Uttar Pradesh,"" Rahul Gandhi stressed.The Congress president, who gave the important assignment to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Jyotiraditya Scindia after the Samajwadi Party and the BSP cold-shouldered him in the ""gathbandhan"" (alliance) for the coming Lok Sabha election, reiterated that he has full respect for BSP chief Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav of SP.""An alliance is also in the contest here and I have clearly said that I respect Mayawatiji and Akhilesh Yadavji...but Congress will fight with all its might for its ideology to change Uttar Pradesh,"" Rahul Gandhi said.""We will play on the front foot...till Congress ideology government takes over here. We will not be sitting idle till we bring a government that works for the farmers, youth and poor here,"" he said.Rahul Gandhi, who along with other leaders, also inaugurated the Congress media centre ""Rajiv Gandhi Hall"" in the party headquarters, asked party workers not to be afraid in this fight of ideology which is to connect people in the face of the challenge of the RSS, BJP and Narendra Modi, who he alleged have been working to break and weaken the country.""The Congress began its journey from Uttar Pradesh and it cannot remain weak in the state...Congress has to improve performance in UP in the Lok Sabha polls and form government in the next Assembly elections,"" he stressed.In his address which was marked by chanting of ""chowkidar chor hai"", Rahul Gandhi alleged that ""in the last five years, ""chowkidar"" has not provided employment, he has just benefitted his friend Anil Ambani.""""People want Congress government as they have tried all and they have failed and now there is only one way ahead...the battle will be fought on the ground,"" he said, adding that the grassroot workers and leaders will have to be given priority if the party has to be strengthened in the state.""This is our responsibility to encourage the grassroot leaders and workers...those who fly in helicopters will not help,"" Rahul, who has the enormous task of strengthening the organisation, stressed.He also referred to PM Modi\'s claims of having 56-inch chest and that he wants to be the chowkidar of the country and said that the truth is coming out one after another and the hollowness of PM Modi\'s claims is coming out before the people.Referring to a report on The Hindu newspaper that critical provisions for anti-corruption penalties and making payments through an escrow account were dropped days before the Rafale deal, Rahul Gandhi said in every defence deal there is a clause of corruption.1 COMMENT""The government can act in case of corruption...but Modi has cancelled it and given Rs. 30,000 crore to Anil Ambani,"" he said.']"

We will not relent until we establish a Congress government in UP,"" Mr Gandhi said.The Congress that once ruled the state has been out of power in Uttar Pradesh for decades now.

Mr Vadra, the husband of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, wasgrilled for over 24 hours altogether for three days last week in another alleged money laundering case on purchase of a property in the UK worth 1.9 million pounds (approximately Rs. 17 crore).Investigators have accused Mr Vadra of letting the personal driver of an associate, Mahesh Nagar, pay for buying land in Rajasthan\'s Bikaner with a cheque drawn on behalf of his mother Maureen, and have questioned the manner in which the transaction was done.The mother-son duo, who landed in Jaipur on Monday afternoon, is expected to visit the probe agency\'s office on Bhawani Singh Road at 10 am on Tuesday.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also reached Jaipur late on Monday after wrapping up her mega roadshow in Lucknow.She is likely to drop off her husband and mother-in-law at the probe agency\'s office this morning. On the first day of Mr Vadra questioning in Delhi last week, Priyanka Gandhi had accompanied him to the ED\'s office as she wanted to send a ""clear message"" with her appearance. ""I stand by my husband,"" she had told NDTV.Last month, the businessman and his mother were told by the Rajasthan High Court to appear before the Enforcement Directorate for recording their statements, after they asked the court to ensure the probe agency refrain from taking any coercive action against them. Mr Vadra went to the court after he got at least three summons from the probe agency, according to news agency PTI.The Enforcement Directorate filed a money laundering case in 2015 after it took note of several First Information Reports (FIRs) filed by the Rajasthan Police, which received complaints from the Bikaner tehsildar on alleged forgery in land allotment in the area, considered sensitive due to its proximity to the border with Pakistan.In his complaint, the tehsildar said government land in 34 villages of Bikaner to be used for expanding the Army\'s firing range was ""grabbed"" by the land mafia with the help of ""forged and fabricated documents"", with the help of some government officials. The ED suspects a huge amount of money was laundered as people bought land at cheap rates through forged documents.The probe agency wants to question Mr Vadra about the operations of a firm, Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd, allegedly linked to him, which had bought land in Bikaner. The ED is likely to confront Mr Vadra with the statements of people who were aware of the transactions, PTI reported.The role of a big steel company that gave loans to another firm, which eventually bought the land from companies linked to Mr Vadra at an inflated price, will be investigated, officials in the probe team said.27 COMMENTSMr Vadra has denied any wrongdoing in the Bikaner case, and accused the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of going down the path of vendetta politics, more so at a time when his wife Priyanka Gandhi has been made the Congress\'s Lok Sabha election campaign in-charge in eastern Uttar Pradesh where the constituencies of PM Modi and the saffron-robed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minster Yogi Adityanath are located.']"

They also stopped for hot tea and little chats on the way; near a decades-old cinema theatre Congress workers surrounded their car.47-year-old Priyanka, no stranger to roadshows with her brother, is campaigning for the first time outside the Gandhi family constituencies of Amethi and Raebareli. For the first time in decades, the party managed to generate a buzz in UP, that too in its capital, which has voted the BJP in every election since 1991.""Priyanka and Scindia-ji will work for the Lok Sabha election but their mission goes beyond that to the assembly polls. We will not relent until we establish a Congress government in UP,"" said Rahul Gandhi in course of the roadshow, stressing that his party was in UP for the long-haul. He threw in his oft-repeated ""Chowkidar chor hai"", targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on corruption. The chant, picked up by the workers, followed them for much of the journey.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has a striking resemblance to Indira GandhiPriyanka, dressed in a light green kurta-churidar, folded her hands or flashed a thumbs up sign as supporters, accompanied by drummers, cheered and shouted slogans. Among the kaleidoscope of posters and billboards lining the roads were those featuring her grandmother Indira Gandhi, playing on her striking resemblance to the former prime minister.As she campaigned in UP, her husband Robert Vadra travelled with his mother Maureen Vadra to Jaipur for questioning by the Enforcement Directorate tomorrow in a money laundering case. Last week, Priyanka, taking her first big stand after joining politics, expressed support for her husband. Today, Robert Vadra posted his wishes on social media, saying ""we hand her over to the people of India. Please keep her safe.""The Congress hopes Priyanka\'s entry into politics will improve its chances in Uttar Pradesh, the state which has the highest number of seats in parliament and which the BJP swept in the 2014 national election, winning 73 of 80 seats. Her older brother announced her political debut as the party\'s general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. Jyotiraditya Scindia will be in charge of the other half of the state.""...I hope that we can all come together to bring about a new kind of politics. A kind of politics in which all of you will be stakeholders,"" Priyanka said in an audio message through the party\'s Shakti App on Sunday.The Congress has put up thousands of posters for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\'s roadshow in LucknowThe roadshow took a 20 km route through some of the most congested areas of the city.Over the next three to four days, Priyanka Gandhi is likely to frequent the party office and chair daily meetings on specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats that she is in charge of. Congress sources say after Lucknow, she may tour eastern Uttar Pradesh before returning to Delhi.Priyanka Gandhi is pitched as a big draw with her charisma and voter connect, but her Congress rescue mission remains a colossal challenge in the state where the party is of little relevance but for a ""vote-cutting"" impact on other parties.The party flopped miserably in its last two poll outings, in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections. Its candidates managed only about 19,000 votes each and a 2 per cent vote share in each constituency.In 2014, the Congress just managed to retain the Gandhi family constituencies of Amethi and Raebareli - as compared to the 21 it had won five years earlier. The party\'s vote share also dropped by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2014.Sources say the party decided on Priyanka Gandhi\'s role after much thought.84 COMMENTSEastern UP is home to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Varanasi constituency and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\'s base Gorakhpur. In the past, Allahabad (or Prayagraj, as it is called now) was Lal Bahadur Shastri\'s Lok Sabha seat and home to the Nehru family. Neighbouring Phulpur was the Lok Sabha seat of Jawaharlal Nehru, India\'s first prime minister and the Gandhi siblings\' great-grandfather.']"
"['New Delhi:Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday unveiled her official Twitter handle, drawing thousands of followers within the first few minutes. The launch of her social media presence came on the same day as her mega roadshow in Lucknow, marking her first visit to Uttar Pradesh after being given charge of the eastern half of the state for the upcoming national elections.Her decision to join active politics last month, after years of maintaining a low profile, sent a wave of excitement among Congress supporters. Since then, she has gradually stepped up her public appearances that have culminated in Monday\'s closely-watched rally.Priyanka Gandhi\'s joining Twitter was announced on the micro-blogging website by the Congress at 11:49 am on Monday. Within 15 minutes, her follower count had crossed 5,000 and 25,000 in the first hour. Though she hadn\'t posted a tweet, she had followed seven people including her brother and party chief Rahul Gandhi. Party leaders Jyotiraditya Scindia, Randeep Singh Surjewala, Ahmed Patel, Ashok Gehlot, Sachin Pilot and the Congress\'s official account were the other six.The Congress and its top leadership has upped its game on social media in the past few months after years of trailing the ruling BJP which has cultivated a strong support base online for years, helping Prime Minister Narendra Modi score a huge win 2014 elections.Political observers have noted marked difference in Congress chief Rahul Gandhi\'s Twitter presence where he has doggedly attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and shared more of his engagements, including trips overseas and vacations.The Congress has put up thousands of posters for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\'s roadshow in Lucknow.For the upcoming elections, the Congress is trying to build an opposition alliance against the BJP, which faces charges of a job crisis and a weak farm economy.21 COMMENTSPriyanka Gandhi Vadra, 47, has campaigned for the Congress party in previous elections to help her brother, but largely stayed in the wings, letting her brother fully take the mantle of the Nehru-Gandhi family that ruled India for most of its post-independence era.']"

Then it was the revelation that \'parallel negotiations\' were being carried on by PMO undermining the efforts of the Indian Negotiating Team,"" he said in a series of tweets.Now it is revealed that crucial changes were made to the clauses in the standard Defence Procurement Procedure, he said.""No sovereign guarantee, no bank guarantee, no escrow account, yet a huge amount was paid as advance,"" Mr Chidambaram alleged.Lashing out at the Modi government, he said, ""No penalty clause for undue influence, no clause against agency commission, no clause for access to suppliers\' accounts, and Dassault goes laughing all the way to the bank.""Citing the media report, Congress\' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, ""Modiji, after waiving off sovereign guarantee in Rafale deal, you also waived off the \'anti-corruption measure\' of a \'safeguard Escrow A/c\'!

"['Lucknow:The fervour among Congress supporters in Uttar Pradesh over Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\'s first visit to the state after being given charge of its eastern half is scraping hysterical levels. Congress supporters have plastered much of Lucknow with posters glorifying her and other top leaders ahead of the roadshow organised through the city from the airport to the Congress offices. One of the posters has gone as far as projecting Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as Goddess Durga.""Sister Priyanka, an avatar of Godess Durga, incinerate the regime of lying thugs,"" reads the poster in Hindi. The poster appears to have been put up by a Youth Congress leader in the city.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\'s decision to join active politics two weeks ago has galvanised the Congress and the morale of its party workers. Ms Gandhi has been tasked with turning around the fortunes of the party in eastern Uttar Pradesh, which accounts for around 40 Lok Sabha seats.Posters welcoming Priyanka Gandhi Vadra have been plastered across Lucknow.For her four-day tour of the state, Priyanka Gandhi will take out a mega roadshow running well over 30 kilometres, through some of the most congested areas of Lucknow.Apart from the roadshow, she is scheduled to address meetings in specific constituencies. Congress sources have also said that instead of returning to Delhi after her tour, Priyanka Gandhi might visit other areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh.6 COMMENTS""Tomorrow, I hope that we can all come together to bring about a new kind of politics.

Addressing a gathering on Sunday near Pune, Nitin Gadkari said, ""We do not believe in casteism...I do not know about you but there is no place for caste in our five districts because I have warned everybody that if anyone talks about caste, I will thrash him,"" said Mr Gadkari who represents Nagpur Lok Sabha seat.The Madhya Pradesh Congress tweeted NDTV Khabar\'s report on the minister\'s comment and said Mr Gadkari had once again ""directly attacked"" Narendra Modi and the BJP. ""Gadkari Ji has spoken out against the politics of religion - a policy followed by the BJP,"" said the tweet, adding, ""When will you thrash those who ask for votes in the name of Hanuman Ji\'s religion?""Several BJP leaders recently made comments speculating on the caste of Lord Hanuman. Former BJP parliamentarian, Savitri Bai Phule had called Lord Hanuman a Dalit. ""Lord Hanuman was a Dalit and a slave of the manuwadi people...,"" she had said. UP minister, Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary had claimed that Lord Hanuman was a ""jat"" and said his assessment was based on the fact that this popular Hindu god has traits similar to the Jat community. A UP BJP councilor, Bukkul Nawab added a new angle to the debate by saying that Lord Hanuman was a Muslim and based his theory only on the name. ""I believe that Lord Hanuman was a Muslim. That is why the names of the people in Islam are almost similar to lord Hanuman, whether it is Rehman, Ramzan, Farman...."" the councilor had said.Mr Gadkari\'s comments over the past few weeks have provided much ammo to the Congress, which reads many of them as hidden messages against his party leadership or PM Modi. Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had posted a comment taunting the Prime Minister after Mr Gadkari had said, ""one who can\'t take care of his home...cannot manage the country."" The minister was apparently advising a person who wanted to work for the BJP and had shared that he had closed his shop because it was not doing well, and that he had a wife and children.88 COMMENTSOn the weekend, Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar had said that the growing buzz about Mr Gadkari as an alternative to PM Modi has left him ""worried"" about his friend. ""He (Nitin Gadkari) is my friend. We have worked together. There is talk about his name being pushed (as an alternative to Narendra Modi) and because of that I am worried about him,"" news agency PTI had quoted Mr Pawar as saying.']"

"['Hubbali, Karnataka:Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy was becoming a ""punching bag"", as he took a swipe at the JD(S)-Congress coalition government in the state. Calling the coalition ""helpless"", PM Modi predicted a similar model for the country if the opposition came into power at the centre.Addressing a rally at Hubbali, PM Modi said there was not even a single day ""when the country doesn\'t see the natak (drama) of the government"", as he launched BJP\'s campaign for the Lok Sabha polls in the party\'s north Karnataka stronghold.PM Modi\'s visit comes amid the political turmoil in the state, with the BJP being accused of trying to dislodge the coalition government.The Prime Minister took potshots at the ruling alliance in the state, saying ""everyone is involved in saving their seat.""Lok Sabha Elections 2019: Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy has often openly expressed his ""helplessness""PM Modi\'s visit also comes when BJP state unit chief B S Yeddyurappa is at the vortex of a row after the chief minister released an audio clip of his purported conversation to lure a JD(S) MLA through his son in his alleged toppling game.Mr Yeddyurappa has dismissed the audio clip as ""fake"".""MLAs are fighting at hotels and breaking their heads. Several Congress leaders are fighting for their supremacy,"" PM Modi said, apparently referring to an alleged brawl between Congress lawmakers Anand Singh and J N Ganesh, in which the former was severely injured.The turmoil has seen both BJP and Congress camping their MLAs at resorts and hotels to prevent possible poaching bids and several wayward Congress lawmakers keeping the party on tenterhooks skipping the assembly session and legislature party meeting.""The Chief Minister here is every one\'s punching bag. Every day he is getting threatened. Chief Minister\'s whole energy is spent on saving his seat from big Congress leaders,"" PM Modi said, referring to Mr Kumaraswamy who, facing coalition pressures, has often openly expressed his ""helplessness"".""Publicly, he weeps about his mazboori (helplessness). Such a helpless government, such a helpless Chief Minister who is being challenged by anyone and everyone. Who is the in charge of the government? There is confusion about it,"" PM Modi said.Setting the ""mazboor (helpless) versus mazboot (strong) government"" narrative, the Prime Minister said, ""Karnataka\'s mazboor model"" was being sought to be imposed on the country, scoffing at efforts of the opposition parties to cobble up a ""mahaghatbandhan"" (grand alliance) against him.""...They want to impose it on the country. Such a helpless model where the head of the government keeps weeping at the corner and decisions are taken in naamdaar\'s palace...they want confusion and the fight for power to continue and the world to laugh at the country. They want to impose this model on the country,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister said the ""New India"" wanted a model that was strong and not a model that was helpless.""Every single vote of yours will decide whether there will be honesty or dishonesty, vikaas (progress) or vanshwaad (dynasty), whether there will be positivity or negativity, whether you want clarity or confusion. The answer to these questions will decide our destiny"" he said.10 COMMENTS""You are witnessing in Delhi who all are falling in line...whose income people used to fear talking about. They are made to make their appearances before court and agencies and answer questions.

It will run from Varanasi to Delhi on its first journey on February 15.The tickets in Train 18 or the Vande Bharat Express, which will eventually replace Shatabdi trains, will be priced higher than the fares of the premium train.114 COMMENTSWith inputs from PTI']"
"['Bengaluru:Rajasthan could see a 2004 like scenario after the coming Lok Sabha elections, when Congress rode back to power after eight years out of office, Deputy chief minister of that state Sachin Pilot said in Bengaluru on Sunday.""Most certainly, the Congress can ride back to power as it did in 2004 after being out of power for eight years.""""There is no way that the BJP will be able to hold on to some 100 seats in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh because the performance of their state and central governments is far from satisfactory,"" he said at ""The Huddle,"" a thought conclave held by \'\'The Hindu\'\' in Bengaluru.Mr Pilot said Indian politics is unpredictable as nobody knew that the late Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee would lose by just one vote.""Likewise, nobody thought that the Congress would come back and form the government in 2004,"" he added. Mr Pilot said that the Indian electorate is sophisticated and sometimes politicians misread and underestimate the competence of voters.""As many as 130 crore people have been watching for the last four years and have been asking questions and getting no answers. It won\'t be surprising if the mighty BJP has a fantastic fall,"" he said.Mr Pilot said that BJP talks of nationalism, mandir-masjid, ghar wapsi and love jihad, but is silent on issues, including food prices and national security.He also said that never before had various institutions in the country been \'\'devalued\'\' like under the BJP.""There is a deliberate and conscious effort in the last four years to devalue institutions. It will have far reaching consequences,"" he added.Asked if Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry into politics would be a game changer, Mr Pilot said that even before she officially took charge, there was a sense of insecurity in BJP.""She is just the general secretary of the Congress, not a Chief Minister or Governor. Why is it causing so much heartburn for the BJP? The political uncertainty it has caused is telling me that they have a reason to fear,"" he said.On BSP and SP ignoring Congress to form an alliance in Uttar Pradesh for the coming Lok Sabha polls, Mr Pilot said nothing was static in politics and the party was likely to perform better than 2009 in the state.""Uttar Pradesh is very critical in the next Lok Sabha elections as it has 80 seats, but the narrative needs to change,"" Mr Pilot said.""People are willing to give the mandate to the Congress. We will do well, much better than the other parties,"" he said. Asked if Congress supported a woman Dalit Prime Minister, Mr Pilot said the party is pro-women and pro-Dalit, but winning adequate number of seats decides leadership issues.""There has been no Prime Minister from the Gandhi family for the past 35 years, so it is wrong to say Rahul Gandhi is doing this to become one. Congress has an equal presence in both northern and southern India,"" he said.Moreover, BJP, which was in power in the cow belt had now lost three states and there is a political messaging that is symbolic of things to come, he added.Asked what was the Congress\' vision for the coming Lok Sabha elections, Mr Pilot said the party manifesto would not be a book of \'\'jumlas\'\' and various details, including the promise of universal basic income, wherever applicable, would be placed before the people in the beginning of March.""Mr Chidambaram is preparing the manifesto.

Rahul Gandhi, brother and Congress president, had announced her entry into politics as the party\'s general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. Priyanka Gandhi will be accompanied by Jyotiraditya Scindia, the party\'s western Uttar Pradesh in-charge, and the Congress chief on the occasion.""Tomorrow, I hope that we can all come together to bring about a new kind of politics. A kind of politics in which all of you will be stakeholders. A kind of politics in which the voice of my youth friends, my sisters and the poorest of the poor will be heard,"" she told supporters through the party\'s Shakti App on Sunday.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visit. From Lucknow airport, all three leaders will proceed to the city\'s Congress office in a roadshow running well over 30 kilometres through some of the most congested areas of the city - garlanding statues of Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar along the way. Congress leaders and workers will gather to welcome her and the others at 14 different points on the route, and party workers from neighbouring districts have been called in to ensure good public presence.After reaching the Congress office, Priyanka Gandhi and the other leaders are expected to address a press conference and inaugurate a new media centre.The Congress has drawn up grand plans to publicise Priyanka Gandhi\'s Lucknow visitOver the next three to four days, she is likely to frequent the party office and chair daily meetings on specific constituencies of the 40-odd Lok Sabha seats that fall under her purview. Congress sources say that once Priyanka Gandhi is done with Lucknow, she may embark on a tour of eastern Uttar Pradesh instead of returning to DelhiBut while the Congress believes that Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry will boost its prospects in the Lok Sabha elections, with her charisma and voter connect being touted as the major draws, a reality check suggests that it could still be a daunting task. The last two Lok Sabha elections in eastern UP - the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls of 2018 - turned out to be disastrous for the party. On both seats, its candidates managed only about 19,000 votes each and a 2% vote share in each constituency.The 2014 Lok Sabha polls was just as tragic for the Congress, bagging just two seats - Amethi and Raebareli - as compared to the 21 it had won five years earlier. The party\'s vote share also dropped by almost 50% between 2009 and 2014. So, the question is: Does Priyanka Gandhi have the time to revive the party\'s seemingly defunct grassroots organisation?Sources say the party decided on Priyanka Gandhi\'s foray into eastern Uttar Pradesh after much thought, and the leadership believes that reviving it in eastern Uttar Pradesh would amount to achieving a symbolic victory.75 COMMENTSAllahabad (or Prayagraj, as it is called now) was Lal Bahadur Shastri\'s Lok Sabha seat and home to the Nehru family. Neighbouring Phulpur was Jawaharlal Nehru\'s Lok Sabha seat. East Uttar Pradesh also has the strongholds of both Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a good showing in a direct fight can boost the party\'s morale immensely. Failure is a possibility too, but that\'s a chance Priyanka Gandhi and her brother are willing to take.']"
"['New Delhi:Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will complement Congress president Rahul Gandhi\'s efforts in winning over young voters and the brother-sister combine will be a game changer for the party in the Lok Sabha polls as the country needs a young team, technocrat-turned-politician Sam Pitroda said on Sunday.He said the Rahul Gandhi-Priyanka Gandhi Vadra duo will make a ""great team"" along with many other young leaders active in the party, including Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Milind Deora, as people who can take the country forward, rather than keeping it hung up on history and religion.Mr Pitroda, the Indian Overseas Congress chief and a long-time friend of the Gandhi family, also said Rahul Gandhi has learnt a lot from the 2014 elections and is much more ""mature, stronger, wiser"", and ready to take on the job of Prime Minister.In an interview with PTI from Chicago, he said India needs a young person with a new inclusive vision of the future, focus on employment, and new opportunities for all, to lead.""India today needs somebody who believes in teamwork, collaboration and cooperation as opposed to a centralised power centre. India today really needs someone who believes in truth rather than lies, who believes in trust and not mistrust, who believes in inclusion and not exclusion. Rahul is at the right age to lead India,"" Mr Pitroda said.Asked about Priyanka Gandhi\'s entry into active politics as AICC general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh East, he said she will be a ""great asset and a good politician"".""She will complement her brother\'s efforts. She will join him in getting young people excited, especially women. They are both young, they represent a large young team in the party, they are modern, they are tech-savvy with a healthy respect for history and new vision for the future.""I am confident that they will attract more young people in the mainstream and that is what a young India needs,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who divides his time between the US and India, is seen as a key adviser of the Gandhis.Asked if the Rahul-Priyanka team will be a game changer for the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls, expected in April-May, he said: ""I think it will be. People will see the benefit of a younger team with a modern outlook. The country needs to look forward rather than backwards, and not get hung up on history and religion.""""But it is not just the Rahul-Priyanka combine. The party has many other young people like Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Milind Deora, to name just a few,"" he said.Mr Pitroda said he is hopeful that Priyanka Gandhi\'s coming into active politics will have a big impact on the polls.Priyanka Gandhi, 47, and Mr Scindia, 48, took charge as AICC general secretary UP east and UP west respectively last week. Mr Pilot, 41, was made deputy chief minister of Rajasthan in December 2018 after the Congress wrested power from BJP. He as well as Mr Deora, 42, and Mr Scindia had served as Union ministers in the last UPA government at the centre.Rahul Gandhi, 48, took charge as Congress chief in December 2017.However, the Congress party has had several presidents who took charge at a younger age, including his father Rajiv Gandhi, grandmother Indira Gandhi, and maternal great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru, as also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.On the BJP\'s charge that the Congress was promoting dynastic politics, Mr Pitroda said dynasty is in every business, but ultimately it is the performance that matters. If you do not perform dynasty cannot help, he said.Rahul Gandhi\'s popularity has increased exponentially after becoming Congress president because once he took over the party, he has had a free hand, Mr Pitroda said.""He could do things that he wanted to do. Earlier, he was constrained in some ways. After becoming Congress president, he had to leave his mark, bring in a young team, respect the old guards, and realise that going forward, he would need new thinking and new blood, and that is what he is trying to do,"" said Mr Pitroda, who headed the Knowledge Commission during the tenure of Manmohan Singh.He said Gandhi has the qualities to make a good prime minister because his heart is in the right place and he is keen on working for the greater good of India and its people.""He (Gandhi) is not driven by personal and vested interests. He is driven by the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid. He is driven by opportunities for the young. He is driven by the welfare of farmers. He is driven by the idea of inclusion...he believes in the idea of India that our founding fathers had,"" Mr Pitroda said.To a question on whether Rahul Gandhi\'s NRI events in foreign countries were similar to the ones Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had during his overseas visits, he said it was not so and the idea behind the trips was not just to have big events with NRIs, but to meet local political and business leaders, interact with students, interact with members of the Indian Overseas Congress, NRIs, and then have a big event to be able to meet them en masse.""He (Gandhi) interacts with students wherever he goes, so it is a different format,"" Mr Pitroda said.Mr Pitroda, who has worked closely with both Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, said they cannot be compared as there is big difference between the India 35 years back and the India now, but added that both were very open to new ideas.4 COMMENTSMr Pitroda led the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi when he set up the C-DOT.

About 60,000 booth level organisers will attend the meeting, according to state BJP chief Basant Panda.This will be Mr Shahs third visit to Odisha this year and the second in 12 days. His last visit to Odisha was on February 3 when he addressed a meeting of BJP\'s ST Morcha at Puri.Earlier, he had visited Cuttack district and addressed a public meeting at Kulia in Salipur block on January 29.On both the occasions, Mr Shah had slammed the Naveen Patnaik-led BJD government in Odisha dubbing it as a ""fused transformer"" which needs to be replaced.Mr Shahs back-to-back visits were followed by a tour of BJP stalwart and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari to Dhenkanal and Paradip on February 6 when he launched a slew of projects.The BJP, which seems to be leaving no stone unturned to brighten its poll prospects, is also organising ""Parivartan Samabesh"" in all the 147 Assembly segments in the state.

I think it is more rhetorical. It is similar in nature to \'garibi hatao\'. And I don\'t think its implementation will be feasible. We neither have that kind of fiscal space, nor that kind of complete data that you need were you to be able to implement it,"" Mr Kumar told IANS in an interview.""This is why, I think, the Congress has left all details completely unclear and have only made a broad announcement,"" he added.Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has, however, said that the broad contours of the scheme justifying its feasibility would be explained in the Congress manifesto.Rejecting the idea of Universal Basic Income for Indians, Mr Kumar said: ""I have not been a supporter of the scheme.

And in that context, an additional Rs. 500 does not sound so little. It should not be dismissed, neither should it be demeaned.""This amount can be used (by a farmer) to send his child to school, to buy rations, to buy water from large land-owners, and so many other things. It\'s not a small amount,"" he said.""Another way to look at it is that in 10 years, you get Rs. 60,000. It\'s not a one-time sop. It\'s a long-term relief. In terms of government expenditure, Rs. 75,000 crore becomes Rs. 7.5 lakh crore in 10 years. It\'s a fair, significant fiscal burden,"" he added.Mr Kumar said that one can always criticize a measure saying it is too little, but it has to be balanced with fiscal responsibility.""Having seen poor households, I don\'t think the sum is too small. It is a significant percentage of total income, not something that disappears in the decimal as you would tend think.""He added the criticism that the scheme leaves out a large part of urban poor out of its net was also unfair and said only 13.7 per cent of farmers were tenants even out of which, 80 per cent owned some land or the other.""So hardly anyone is left out among the agriculture farming households. The only people who are not included are the landless labour. That is only 2.6 per cent of the rural population. That has been left out because for them, there is MNREGA. That is what gives them social security,"" Mr Kumar said.""The coverage is not narrow. It covers 12 crore households - around 60 crore people. It is much bigger than any farm loan waiver would cover, which are by nature skewed or biased towards larger land-owners.""In a sharp criticism of loan waiver schemes announced by the newly-formed governments in the Hindi-heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, he said it was not the answer to agricultural distress.""Farm distress can be sorted out through true modernisation of the sector - convert farmer from mere producer of commodities to a producer of agricultural value products. The second part of solving the crisis is to connect the farmer to the market - get logistics in place.68 COMMENTS""And finally, you have to lower the cost of production in agriculture. At the moment, Indian agriculture products are higher-priced than global prices. There I think, one has to move away from the model of increasing doses of chemical inputs into agriculture, resulting in higher cost, higher debt and higher distress.

These include two houses, one worth 5 million pounds and the other valued at 4 million pounds and six flats. The total worth of these properties is 12 million pounds.The ED also grilled Mr Vadra about the mails he exchanged with Sumit Chadha, a relative of Mr Bhandari, in reference to a London property. Mr Vadra was also asked how he knew Mr Bhandari and Mr Chadha and what business transactions they had.According to sources, Mr Vadra was confronted with the emails he had reportedly exchanged with Mr Chadha for the payment of the renovation of a London property, about which the agency informed a Delhi court.The ED also told the court that the London property was part of the kickbacks received in a petroleum deal.According to the ED, Mr Vadra and his associates received \'kickbacks\' in the petroleum deal signed in 2009 during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime.3 COMMENTSThe ED claimed that money was allegedly transferred to Santech International, FZC, a company based in UAE and controlled by Mr Bhandari.
