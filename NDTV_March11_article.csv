But according to a government press release, the plant, inaugurated in 2007, began production of carbines, rifles, and INSAS machine guns in late 2010.Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated to the nation a Kalashnikov Assault Rifle Production plant in Uttar Pradesh\'s Amethi.In another instance, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for a sewage network at Karmalichak in Bihar on February 17.

For example, the inauguration of passenger service for a section of Chennai Metro, the doubling of the Chikjajur-Mayakonda section of a railway line in Karnataka, four-laning of the National Highway(NH)-45C from Vikravandi to Thanjavur and six-laning of the Karaipettai-Walajapet section of NH-4, both in Tamil Nadu.Some launches appeared to be at municipality level, such as laying a foundation stone for the refurbishment of a gaushala (cow shelter) under the Ghaziabad Municipality, and inaugurating a 37 km sewage line, sewer facilities for 9,000 houses and so on in the same city near Delhi.PM Modi launched a power plant in Bihar\'s Buxar through a video conference from Uttar Pradesh.Given the shortage of time, the Prime Minister also took to remotely launching at least 17 of the projects in the last month, including an instance from Saturday, as he launched a power plant in Bihar\'s Buxar through a video conference from Uttar Pradesh.88 COMMENTSEnquiries sent to the Prime Minister\'s Office and the Press Information Bureau were not met with a response.']"

In a two-minute clip shared by the newspaper, the billionaire, who is wanted in India in a Rs. 13,000 crore bank fraud case, said ""no comments"" at least six times to questions ranging from how long he planned to stay in the UK to how much money he owed.Stockier than before and not easy to recognise, Nirav Modi was in a pink shirt and an expensive jacket, sporting a handlebar moustache. The 48-year-old continued to evade questions as he walked briskly in an apparent effort to lose the reporter. He stopped near a cab, but moved on after speaking to the driver. The reporter followed him for some time till he finally got into another cab and left.The British newspaper in its report said Nirav Modi has started a new diamond business in Soho, a part of the posh West End area in London.When the reporter asked whether he had applied for political asylum, Nirav Modi said, ""Sorry, no comment."" Then he walked across the road in his black Ostrich hide jacket that normally costs upwards of 10,000 pounds (over Rs. 9 lakh).Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi are the prime accused in the Punjab National Bank scam involving fake guarantees in the name of the state-run lender to secure loans overseas. Both left India in January last year before the CBI started investigating the PNB scam.Mehul Choksi now holds the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda and has cited an illness and threat of mob lynching as reasons for not returning to India.Nirav Modi\'s lawyer told courts that he was also afraid of being lynched. ""I have been projected as evil and being made the poster boy of the bank fraud,"" his lawyer told a Mumbai courton his behalf in December last year.

The apartment is worth 8 million pounds (Rs. 75 crore), the newspaper said.The newspaper, quoting government sources, reported that Nirav Modi has been given a national insurance number - needed to legally work in the UK - and has been operating bank accounts online while being wanted by India. The report said it is not clear why was he given the national insurance number.Government sources in India said attempts are on to bring him back. ""Our message is clear. If you have committed fraud, you will be brought back to face justice. He is living like a refugee in London,"" a top government source told NDTV.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar today said the government already knew Nirav Modi was in the UK.

He said the party will take a decision on Mathura soon.Asked how the workers of the three parties will be able to connect at the ground level with the seat-sharing talks having taken a long time, Jayant said he believes regional parties have a better connect with their workers.""This alliance decision was not a top-down process but in fact taken after feedback from workers and leaders. That is why you haven\'t seen problems in accommodation and adjustments between the BSP, SP and RLD. This means that the ground is already ready for us. Now we just need to keep up the campaign,"" the 40-year-old leader said.On the equation between the Congress and the grand alliance in UP, Mr Chaudhary said the issue had been addressed at the recent press interaction in Lucknow and he did not have any more information on it.After repeated questions by reporters at the press conference, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had said the Congress was ""very much in the alliance"". ""We have left two seats (Amethi and Rae Bareli) for the party (Congress),"" he had said.Jayant, grandson of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, said the electoral contest between the opposition and the BJP would be a ""make or break"" for the right idea of India.""The mainstreaming of violence, the \'\'othering\'\' of our minorities and weaker sections, the saffron washing of our cultural heritage, the nonchalance with which even our intelligentsia is ready to dismiss diverse opinions, the intentioned and sustained attack on institutional credibility, make this a make or break for our idea of an inclusive, progressive, developing Bharat!"" he said.Asked about the narrative of Modi versus the rest and the BJP\'\'s ""mahamilavat"" (highly adulterated) barb at opposition alliances, the RLD leader said the fact is that the diversity of India can have true political representation only through alliances.The BJP also ran a government in alliance with many parties and will have tie-ups in many states including UP, he said.Slamming the BJP for the PM Modi versus the rest narrative and the ""mahamilavat"" jibe, Mr Chaudhary said leaders don\'t walk alone, they build a team of capable leaders and this has been Modi\'s ""big failure"" in government.""We know that he likes to work alone and walk alone, but India needs a leadership that listens to feedback, collaborates with others and respects diversity,"" he said.Hitting out at the use of the term ""mahamilavat"" by PM Modi and the BJP, he said it betrays a ""negative mindset"".""The notion of purity was the basic foundation of caste oppression in India. To imply that the opposition is impure, to me, this slogan uses the language and symbolism that divided our country into castes and that is why I strongly object to it,"" he said.Asked whether national security and the post-Pulwama airstrikes will be the major issues in UP or the alleged agrarian distress, Mr Chaudhary said it is the ""jawan and kisan who have borne the brunt of the myopic and adhoc policies the incumbent government has unleashed over last five years"".""Therefore, both will feature prominently. Note ban had a debilitating impact on rural livelihoods, and economic activities in our hinterland. Farmers have faced rising input costs, depressed produce prices and diminishing returns,"" he alleged.Rural labourers and artisans, as well as dairy farmers have also suffered.

With the maximum number of seats, the politically vital state is set to host the most-watched election battle that will test an opposition alliance of bitter rivals Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, joining hands to take on the BJP, which scooped a colossal 73 seats in the 2014 election.The route to power at the Centre is through Uttar Pradesh, and the BJP\'s sweep in the last polls was seen as the big chunk in its 2014 landslide; it was the first party to win a majority on its own in three decades.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the 71 BJP lawmakers who won in UP. The Samajwadi party won five, the Congress two and Mayawati\'s BSP won zero. The BJP followed up its Lok Sabha feat by ousting the Samajwadi Party in the state election in 2017.This time, the BJP faces a resurgent opposition that has already bagged telling victories in recent by-polls. Two of those wins was particularly sweet for the opposition - the BJP lost two strongholds, including Gorakhpur, the home base of its star campaigner Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.The biggest takeaway from these polls for the opposition was that if Mayawati\'s BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Akhilesh Yadav\'s Samajwadi Party team up, then beating the BJP is not impossible. Together, the two parties can potentially win over 40 seats. Along with the Congress, that could go up to 50.The two announced their alliance for the national election in January, but delivered a blow to the opposition ""gathbandhan"" bonhomie by leaving out the Congress.Days later, the Congress served its reply. The grand old party - for decades an also-ran in UP -- announced the debut of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as its campaign in-charge for the state along with Jyotiraditya Scindia.Priyanka Gandhi, the younger sister of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, had so far confined herself to Amethi and Raebareli, the constituencies of her brother and her mother Sonia Gandhi.The Congress is banking on Priyanka Gandhi\'s charisma and connect - and striking resemblance to her grandmother Indira Gandhi - to improve its score in Uttar Pradesh. It managed to retain only the Gandhis\' seats in 2014; anything more than that will be an improvement.Confronting an aggressive opposition, the BJP has upped its game. Over the past few months, PM Modi has focused on UP and his constituency Varanasi.

He now ceases to be a member of the Gujarat Assembly,"" Mr Trivedi said.Commenting on his decision, Mr Sabariya said he was joining the ruling BJP to develop his constituency.""I was not under any pressure because of the pending case. I am already out on bail. I have resigned voluntarily. I am not dissatisfied with any Congress leader. I am joining the ruling BJP as I felt that this is the best way to serve the people of my constituency,"" he said.The former lawmaker claimed that he was not offered any ministership in the Gujarat government by the BJP.Mr Sabariya was arrested in October last year for allegedly demanding and accepting a bribe from persons accused in an irrigation scam in Morbi district in return for not raising the issue in the Assembly and with the state government.Just an hour before Mr Sabariya\'s resignation, Mr Chavda joined the BJP at party headquarters in Gandhinagar after giving his resignation as the MLA of Manavadar seat in Junagadh district.Mr Chavda, 55, a four-time MLA, was inducted into the party by state Home Minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja and senior party leader KC Patel.After joining the BJP, Mr Chavda said he has not left the Congress out of any discontent or differences with the Congress leadership.Mr Chavda, a prominent OBC leader from Ahir community, said he also resigned from the primary membership of the Congress and sent a letter to party president Rahul Gandhi to inform him about his decision.Talking to reporters, he claimed that the BJP has not offered ministership to switch sides ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.""It is not true that I am joining the BJP to become a minister. I am in politics to serve the people. I am joining the BJP as I felt that I can serve the people in a better way if I join the party that is in power.""I also felt it necessary to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the current security scenario of the country,"" Mr Chavda said.He had won the Manavadar seat in 1990, 2007, 2012 and 2017.Though speculations are rife that he would be made a minister in the coming days, both Mr Chavda and Mr Jadeja dismissed the reports.

A video of the interview - uploaded on Thursday - was circulated widely on social media.""Keeping in view the interests of Bihar, I think it was okay. But I do not agree with the method adopted. I have said this earlier and I still hold the view that upon taking the decision to return to the BJP-led coalition, he should have ideally sought a fresh mandate,"" PTI quoted the party\'s national vice-president as saying.According to the news agency, Mr Kishor cited Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and Biju Janata Dal chief Naveen Patnaik to illustrate that turnarounds by politicians were not such a rare occurrence in India. He also said that there was no yardstick to measure if the Janata Dal (United) president was right in taking the drastic decision of walking out of the grand alliance - which consisted of Lalu Yadav\'s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress - in July 2017.""For those who saw in him (Mr Kumar) a potential challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the move was a let-down. But those who were of the view that he had begun to compromise on governance in his zeal to take on PM Modi would feel he was right,"" PTI quoted Mr Kishor as saying.The RJD latched on to Mr Kishor\'s words to assert that they were right about the Janata Dal (United) chief after all. ""This statement by the Janata Dal (United) national vice-president is tantamount to admitting what has been our charge all along... Nitish Kumar\'s act of crossing over without seeking a fresh mandate amounted to stabbing the grand alliance in the back,"" said party spokesperson Bhai Virendra.However, another Janata Dal (United) leader - Ramchandra Prasad Singh - clarified that Mr Kishor was speaking in his personal capacity because he was not even a member of the party when it tied up with the BJP.3 COMMENTSThe poll strategist-turned politician had earlier made headlines by describing the entry of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress president Rahul Gandhi\'s sister, into politics as one of the ""most awaited"" in India.

The National Democratic Alliance had won 41 seats in the last Lok Sabha elections, leaving the Congress-NCP combine with just 6.Last month, NCP president Sharad Pawar said that efforts are on to forge a ""grand alliance"" against the BJP in Maharashtra for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. ""We will continue to fight the RSS.

Mr Pawar believed it was a good way to prevent a split in the anti-BJP mandate, given that the MNS had secured over one lakh votes in some constituencies.The suggestion was shot down by the Congress, which held that its ideological differences with the regional party were way too stark for that to happen. ""We have ideological differences with MNS, and any kind of electoral tie-up with it would be difficult,"" Congress state chief Ashok Chavan was quoted as saying by PTI.The BJP, however, managed to seal an alliance with the Shiv Sena last month -- setting aside three years of bickering with the help of a 50-50 seat-sharing agreement.

In a two-minute clip shared by the newspaper, the billionaire, who is wanted in India in a Rs. 13,000 crore bank fraud case, said ""no comments"" at least six times to questions ranging from how long he planned to stay in the UK to how much money he owed.Stockier than before and not easy to recognise, Nirav Modi was in a pink shirt and an expensive jacket, sporting a handlebar moustache. The 48-year-old continued to evade questions as he walked briskly in an apparent effort to lose the reporter. He stopped near a cab, but moved on after speaking to the driver. The reporter followed him for some time till he finally got into another cab and left.The British newspaper in its report said Nirav Modi has started a new diamond business in Soho, a part of the posh West End area in London.When the reporter asked whether he had applied for political asylum, Nirav Modi said, ""Sorry, no comment."" Then he walked across the road in his black Ostrich hide jacket that normally costs upwards of 10,000 pounds (over Rs. 9 lakh).Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi are the prime accused in the Punjab National Bank scam involving fake guarantees in the name of the state-run lender to secure loans overseas. Both left India in January last year before the CBI started investigating the PNB scam.Mehul Choksi now holds the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda and has cited an illness and threat of mob lynching as reasons for not returning to India.Nirav Modi\'s lawyer told courts that he was also afraid of being lynched. ""I have been projected as evil and being made the poster boy of the bank fraud,"" his lawyer told a Mumbai courton his behalf in December last year.

The apartment is worth 8 million pounds (Rs. 75 crore), the newspaper said.The newspaper, quoting government sources, reported that Nirav Modi has been given a national insurance number - needed to legally work in the UK - and has been operating bank accounts online while being wanted by India. The report said it is not clear why was he given the national insurance number.Government sources in India said attempts are on to bring him back. ""Our message is clear. If you have committed fraud, you will be brought back to face justice. He is living like a refugee in London,"" a top government source told NDTV.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar today said the government already knew Nirav Modi was in the UK.

He said the party will take a decision on Mathura soon.Asked how the workers of the three parties will be able to connect at the ground level with the seat-sharing talks having taken a long time, Jayant said he believes regional parties have a better connect with their workers.""This alliance decision was not a top-down process but in fact taken after feedback from workers and leaders. That is why you haven\'t seen problems in accommodation and adjustments between the BSP, SP and RLD. This means that the ground is already ready for us. Now we just need to keep up the campaign,"" the 40-year-old leader said.On the equation between the Congress and the grand alliance in UP, Mr Chaudhary said the issue had been addressed at the recent press interaction in Lucknow and he did not have any more information on it.After repeated questions by reporters at the press conference, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had said the Congress was ""very much in the alliance"". ""We have left two seats (Amethi and Rae Bareli) for the party (Congress),"" he had said.Jayant, grandson of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, said the electoral contest between the opposition and the BJP would be a ""make or break"" for the right idea of India.""The mainstreaming of violence, the \'\'othering\'\' of our minorities and weaker sections, the saffron washing of our cultural heritage, the nonchalance with which even our intelligentsia is ready to dismiss diverse opinions, the intentioned and sustained attack on institutional credibility, make this a make or break for our idea of an inclusive, progressive, developing Bharat!"" he said.Asked about the narrative of Modi versus the rest and the BJP\'\'s ""mahamilavat"" (highly adulterated) barb at opposition alliances, the RLD leader said the fact is that the diversity of India can have true political representation only through alliances.The BJP also ran a government in alliance with many parties and will have tie-ups in many states including UP, he said.Slamming the BJP for the PM Modi versus the rest narrative and the ""mahamilavat"" jibe, Mr Chaudhary said leaders don\'t walk alone, they build a team of capable leaders and this has been Modi\'s ""big failure"" in government.""We know that he likes to work alone and walk alone, but India needs a leadership that listens to feedback, collaborates with others and respects diversity,"" he said.Hitting out at the use of the term ""mahamilavat"" by PM Modi and the BJP, he said it betrays a ""negative mindset"".""The notion of purity was the basic foundation of caste oppression in India. To imply that the opposition is impure, to me, this slogan uses the language and symbolism that divided our country into castes and that is why I strongly object to it,"" he said.Asked whether national security and the post-Pulwama airstrikes will be the major issues in UP or the alleged agrarian distress, Mr Chaudhary said it is the ""jawan and kisan who have borne the brunt of the myopic and adhoc policies the incumbent government has unleashed over last five years"".""Therefore, both will feature prominently. Note ban had a debilitating impact on rural livelihoods, and economic activities in our hinterland. Farmers have faced rising input costs, depressed produce prices and diminishing returns,"" he alleged.Rural labourers and artisans, as well as dairy farmers have also suffered.

With the maximum number of seats, the politically vital state is set to host the most-watched election battle that will test an opposition alliance of bitter rivals Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, joining hands to take on the BJP, which scooped a colossal 73 seats in the 2014 election.The route to power at the Centre is through Uttar Pradesh, and the BJP\'s sweep in the last polls was seen as the big chunk in its 2014 landslide; it was the first party to win a majority on its own in three decades.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the 71 BJP lawmakers who won in UP. The Samajwadi party won five, the Congress two and Mayawati\'s BSP won zero. The BJP followed up its Lok Sabha feat by ousting the Samajwadi Party in the state election in 2017.This time, the BJP faces a resurgent opposition that has already bagged telling victories in recent by-polls. Two of those wins was particularly sweet for the opposition - the BJP lost two strongholds, including Gorakhpur, the home base of its star campaigner Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.The biggest takeaway from these polls for the opposition was that if Mayawati\'s BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Akhilesh Yadav\'s Samajwadi Party team up, then beating the BJP is not impossible. Together, the two parties can potentially win over 40 seats. Along with the Congress, that could go up to 50.The two announced their alliance for the national election in January, but delivered a blow to the opposition ""gathbandhan"" bonhomie by leaving out the Congress.Days later, the Congress served its reply. The grand old party - for decades an also-ran in UP -- announced the debut of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as its campaign in-charge for the state along with Jyotiraditya Scindia.Priyanka Gandhi, the younger sister of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, had so far confined herself to Amethi and Raebareli, the constituencies of her brother and her mother Sonia Gandhi.The Congress is banking on Priyanka Gandhi\'s charisma and connect - and striking resemblance to her grandmother Indira Gandhi - to improve its score in Uttar Pradesh. It managed to retain only the Gandhis\' seats in 2014; anything more than that will be an improvement.Confronting an aggressive opposition, the BJP has upped its game. Over the past few months, PM Modi has focused on UP and his constituency Varanasi.

He was granted bail in February by the Gujarat High Court.""Congress MLA from Dhrangadhra seat, Parsotam Sabariya, tendered his resignation today evening. I have accepted his resignation. He has not given any particular reason in his resignation letter. He now ceases to be a member of the Gujarat Assembly,"" Mr Trivedi said.Commenting on his decision, Mr Sabariya said he was joining the ruling BJP to develop his constituency.""I was not under any pressure because of the pending case. I am already out on bail. I have resigned voluntarily. I am not dissatisfied with any Congress leader. I am joining the ruling BJP as I felt that this is the best way to serve the people of my constituency,"" he said.The former lawmaker claimed that he was not offered any ministership in the Gujarat government by the BJP.Mr Sabariya was arrested in October last year for allegedly demanding and accepting a bribe from persons accused in an irrigation scam in Morbi district in return for not raising the issue in the Assembly and with the state government.Just an hour before Mr Sabariya\'s resignation, Mr Chavda joined the BJP at party headquarters in Gandhinagar after giving his resignation as the MLA of Manavadar seat in Junagadh district.Mr Chavda, 55, a four-time MLA, was inducted into the party by state Home Minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja and senior party leader KC Patel.After joining the BJP, Mr Chavda said he has not left the Congress out of any discontent or differences with the Congress leadership.Mr Chavda, a prominent OBC leader from Ahir community, said he also resigned from the primary membership of the Congress and sent a letter to party president Rahul Gandhi to inform him about his decision.Talking to reporters, he claimed that the BJP has not offered ministership to switch sides ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.""It is not true that I am joining the BJP to become a minister. I am in politics to serve the people. I am joining the BJP as I felt that I can serve the people in a better way if I join the party that is in power.""I also felt it necessary to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the current security scenario of the country,"" Mr Chavda said.He had won the Manavadar seat in 1990, 2007, 2012 and 2017.Though speculations are rife that he would be made a minister in the coming days, both Mr Chavda and Mr Jadeja dismissed the reports.

A video of the interview - uploaded on Thursday - was circulated widely on social media.""Keeping in view the interests of Bihar, I think it was okay. But I do not agree with the method adopted. I have said this earlier and I still hold the view that upon taking the decision to return to the BJP-led coalition, he should have ideally sought a fresh mandate,"" PTI quoted the party\'s national vice-president as saying.According to the news agency, Mr Kishor cited Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and Biju Janata Dal chief Naveen Patnaik to illustrate that turnarounds by politicians were not such a rare occurrence in India. He also said that there was no yardstick to measure if the Janata Dal (United) president was right in taking the drastic decision of walking out of the grand alliance - which consisted of Lalu Yadav\'s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress - in July 2017.""For those who saw in him (Mr Kumar) a potential challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the move was a let-down. But those who were of the view that he had begun to compromise on governance in his zeal to take on PM Modi would feel he was right,"" PTI quoted Mr Kishor as saying.The RJD latched on to Mr Kishor\'s words to assert that they were right about the Janata Dal (United) chief after all. ""This statement by the Janata Dal (United) national vice-president is tantamount to admitting what has been our charge all along... Nitish Kumar\'s act of crossing over without seeking a fresh mandate amounted to stabbing the grand alliance in the back,"" said party spokesperson Bhai Virendra.However, another Janata Dal (United) leader - Ramchandra Prasad Singh - clarified that Mr Kishor was speaking in his personal capacity because he was not even a member of the party when it tied up with the BJP.3 COMMENTSThe poll strategist-turned politician had earlier made headlines by describing the entry of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress president Rahul Gandhi\'s sister, into politics as one of the ""most awaited"" in India.

The National Democratic Alliance had won 41 seats in the last Lok Sabha elections, leaving the Congress-NCP combine with just 6.Last month, NCP president Sharad Pawar said that efforts are on to forge a ""grand alliance"" against the BJP in Maharashtra for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. ""We will continue to fight the RSS. We don\'t agree with their ideology, and all like-minded parties should come together to fight it,"" news agency PTI had quoted him as saying.It was in keeping with this idea that the NCP pushed for including the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) into the alliance. Mr Pawar believed it was a good way to prevent a split in the anti-BJP mandate, given that the MNS had secured over one lakh votes in some constituencies.The suggestion was shot down by the Congress, which held that its ideological differences with the regional party were way too stark for that to happen. ""We have ideological differences with MNS, and any kind of electoral tie-up with it would be difficult,"" Congress state chief Ashok Chavan was quoted as saying by PTI.The BJP, however, managed to seal an alliance with the Shiv Sena last month -- setting aside three years of bickering with the help of a 50-50 seat-sharing agreement.
