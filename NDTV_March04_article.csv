The machines were not visible in the television frame. What drew attention to them was a series of photos tweeted by a state minister from his party. The close-up shots tweeted by Mangal Pandey, the health minister in Nitish Kumar\'s cabinet, showed the slim, transparent devices on the Prime Minister\'s left. In a couple of shots, he also appeared to be looking at it.The sight brought a sharp reaction from opposition leader Lalu PrasadYadav, who jeered that the Prime Minister is ""losing confidence"" at the prospect of defeat in Bihar.Lalu Prasad Yadav, who is currently in jail in several fodder scam cases, tweeted: ""Rattled by the failure of his schemes, a man can speak any lie; throw any “jumla”. The prospect of defeat in Bihar has shaken PM Modi\'s confidence to such an extent that he has to look at a teleprompter to give a speech in Hindi.""PM Modi is known to use a teleprompter at public functions, especially where he has to give prepared speeches in English.BJP sources said that it was a prop to refresh his memory on facts and figures.Some sources also said while PM Modi had used a teleprompter during January\'s National Council Meet in Delhi, but he still prefers to use his notes.Citing facts in speeches that don\'t appear to tally, has triggered considerable political sparring in the run up to the national elections. On both side of the political divide, leaders have been accused of lies and political gimmick.2 COMMENTSToday, in response to Union minister VK Singh\'s invitation to ""crowdsource"" the ""lies"" of Rahul Gandhi, his cabinet colleague Rajyavardhan Rathore tweeted a video clip that showed finance minister Arun Jaitley questioning figures quoted by the Congress chief on the Rafale deal.']"

The strikes were in response to the terror attack in Pulwama in which about 40 CRPF personnel lost their lives. JeM had claimed the responsibility of the attack.The camp, located in a forest area atop a hill, was headed by JeM chief Masood Azhars\' brother-in-law Yusuf Azhar alias Ustad Gauri, who was involved in the 1999 hijack of Indian Airlines plane IC-814 and was on Interpol lookout notice since 2000.Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said the pre-emptive strike by India had become absolutely necessary as there was credible information that JeM was planning further attacks in the country.On February 27, India said it foiled an attempt by Pakistan Air Force to carry out strikes in Jammu and Kashmir by shooting down an F-16 fighter plane while losing its own MiG-21 jet after which a pilot was missing in action.Pakistan later acknowledged that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who ejected across the Line of Control, is in its custody.1 COMMENTPakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced on Thursday in the country\'s Parliament that the IAF pilot will be released tomorrow as a ""peace gesture"".

"['Varanasi:Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised people by washing the feet of sanitation workers during his visit to the Kumbh in Prayagraj, two workers who were cleaning a blocked sewage line, died in his constituency, Varanasi on Friday. The two men have been identified as Rajesh Paswan and Chandan; both in their twenties, say reports.The two sanitation workers were called to clear a blocked pipe at a sewage treatment plant in Varanasi\'s Pandeypur area. They had gone down a four-feet deep manhole when the ground caved in. Eyewitnesses claim there were mounds of construction debris lying very close to the manhole.The police were called by people in the neighbourhood. When they could not trace the two men, teams of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) started rescue operations. The NDRF team took six hours to take out the bodies of the two sanitation workers.Local people alleged complete negligence on the part of the authorities, who apparently did not provide any protective gear to the two sanitation workers. Angry people protested after the horrific incident; they alleged that no one bothered to clean the debris in the area, which was accumulating for a while.The police have started an investigation into the incident.Describing the sanitation workers as the ""real karm yogis"", PM Modi took to Twitter after washing their feet last week and said, ""Moments I\'ll cherish for my entire life! Honouring remarkable safai karamcharis, who have taken the lead when it comes to realising the dream of a Swachh Bharat!""4 COMMENTSAfter several opposition leaders called the Prime Minister\'s act an election gimmick, Mr Modi on Thursday said that washing the feet of sanitation workers was not intended for political gains, but an outcome of his \'\'sanskar\'\' (values).

He visited the neighbouring Rae Bareli constituency, represented in Lok Sabha by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in December.According to official sources, PM Modi will address a public meeting in Kauhar area of Gauriganj and will launch some projects besides laying the foundation stone of a new unit of the Munshiganj Ordnance Factory, where assault rifles will be made in collaboration with Russia, on Sunday.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited Amethi earlier this week to review preparations for the prime minister\'s visit.PM Modi previously visited Amethi on May 5, 2014 and the BJP, which had fielded party leader Smriti Irani against Rahul Gandhi in 2014 general election, had managed three lakh votes.Ms Irani has been camping in the constituency since and is expected to contest again in the coming poll, expected to be held in April-May.State BJP general secretary Govind Narain Shukla, who is the convenor of the prime minister\'s public meeting, said, ""It will be a historic meeting in Kauhar with over 1.25 lakh people likely to attend it.""In 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the BJP had won four of the five assembly constituencies under Amethi Lok Sabha seat, with SP winning one.Meanwhile, Congress workers have objected to the white-washing of the wall paintings of their leader, Rahul Gandhi, near the meeting venue.1 COMMENTMr Gandhi\'s representative, Chandrakant Dubey, said white-washing the paintings of the local MP was ""very sad and unfortunate"" and only shows the intolerance of BJP leaders and workers.']"

"['New Delhi:Accusing the Congress-led UPA of running a ""terrible"" government and even a ""more terrible"" opposition, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Sunday said their statements have hurt India\'s national interest and gave handle to Pakistan to discredit the country.Within days of India\'s air strike at Balakot, the 21 opposition parties led by the Congress passed a resolution accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of politicising the Pulwama and Balakot incidents.""Statements made by opposition parties (after IAF\'s counter terror operation in Balakot) hurt India\'s national interest. They give smiles to Pakistan and become an instrument in Pakistan\'s hands to discredit India\'s operation against terrorism,"" Mr Jaitley said in a blog, stressing that on such occasions the nation ought to speak in one voice as was done by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Jan Sangh during the 1971 war.Terming the resolution passed by 21 opposition parties as inappropriate, he said, it gave a handle to the enemy and Pakistan\'s media used the statement as a trump card.The government had twice taken the leaders of opposition parties into confidence, he said.Referring to the statement of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the finance minister said that he sought to elevate himself to the status of a neutral third party while raising doubts about India\'s right to defend its sovereignty from those who want to damage it through terrorism.""I was most disappointed with a brief but a highly objectionable statement of the former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh,"" Mr Jaitley said.While receiving the PV Narasimha Rao Award for the lifetime achievement, Dr Singh had stated that he was disturbed with the ""Mad rush of mutual self-destruction"" by the two nations. Dr Singh further went on to argue that poverty, ignorance and disease were the real problems in the two countries and that saner counsel on both sides needed to think on the issue.Mr Jaitley wondered that there was no condemnation of terrorism in that speech of the former prime minister.Implicitly, he doubts India\'s right to defend its sovereignty from those who want to damage it through terrorism, he said.Mr Jaitley further said: ""The Congress-led UPA Government from 2004 to 2014 ran a terrible Government. From 2014 to 2019, it was even a more terrible Opposition"".Pointing that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee went a step further, he said, she started doubting the veracity of the incident and wanted to know the operational details.""The credibility of both the Government and our Air Force is being doubted. Even Congress leaders have raised similar questions,"" he said in a Facebook post titled India\'s Opposition Has A Lot To Learn.Mr Jaitley emphasised that the Opposition is entitled to oppose and ask questions, but then restrain and statesmanship are also essential ingredients of public discourse.He expressed hope that India\'s Opposition revisits its position and does not let down the nation.Mr Jaitley also pointed that the retaliatory attack by Pakistan\'s F-16 was the most botched up operation and the neighbouring country was globally isolated.""Not only was Pakistan globally isolated, the issue of its terrorism has reached the Security Council. So helpless was the situation that it was in no position to even admit the attack at Balakot. If it had admitted the attack and its consequences, the evidence of a terrorist camp in existence and the list of dead terrorists would have been international issue,"" he said.Reacting to Mr Jaitley\'s post, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala in a tweet said: ""\'Blog Minister\' continues his antics as a self styled \'Caricaturist\' to stay relevant by attacking Dr. Manmohan Singh. COMMENTAtleast 5 Surgical Strikes took place under Dr. Singh\'s charge but he didn\'t make bravery of Jawans a political pamphlet for votes.""']"

The past government promised to employ 1,500 people... only 200 people were employed.""Amid chants of ""Rahul Gandhi chor hai"", he added, ""I\'m not naming anybody... but you all know who I am talking about... Just the way they ignored national security... they ignored Amethi too.""Rahul Gandhi has been representing Amethi in parliament for three consecutive terms. His parents, Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, had also been lawmakers from the constituency.In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP\'s Smriti Irani challenged Mr Gandhi on the seat, claiming that he and his family have done little for the people in the area.Though she lost, she had been visiting the constituency regularly in an effort to carve out a niche. In the 2017 assembly elections, the Congress lost all four assembly seats it had under the Lok Sabha constituency, the BJP had won three of them.Ms Irani got a pat on the back from the Prime Minister today. ""You (the people) showered so much love on Smriti Ji... she worked so hard and it never appeared that she had lost from Amethi,"" he added.41 COMMENTSAmong the other initiatives launched today, the Prime Minister said, were projects for healthcare and cattle shelters.']"

The Prime Minister had last addressed a rally at Gandhi Maidan in October 2013, in the run-up to the last Lok Sabha election.In the days preceding the rally, Lalu Yadav\'s son -- RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav -- had dared the Chief Minister to demand special status for the state from PM Modi. ""Modi had promised special category status for Bihar, but until now, the promise has not been fulfilled. Nitishji, tomorrow is the right time for your leader to formally announce special category status for Bihar from the dais of the Sankalp rally,"" he said.At the rally, the Prime Minister responded to the accusation by underscoring all the ways in which the centre had helped the people of the state.

When they could not trace the two men, teams of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) started rescue operations. The NDRF team took six hours to take out the bodies of the two sanitation workers.Local people alleged complete negligence on the part of the authorities, who apparently did not provide any protective gear to the two sanitation workers. Angry people protested after the horrific incident; they alleged that no one bothered to clean the debris in the area, which was accumulating for a while.The police have started an investigation into the incident.Describing the sanitation workers as the ""real karm yogis"", PM Modi took to Twitter after washing their feet last week and said, ""Moments I\'ll cherish for my entire life! Honouring remarkable safai karamcharis, who have taken the lead when it comes to realising the dream of a Swachh Bharat!""4 COMMENTSAfter several opposition leaders called the Prime Minister\'s act an election gimmick, Mr Modi on Thursday said that washing the feet of sanitation workers was not intended for political gains, but an outcome of his \'\'sanskar\'\' (values). He was responding to a question by a BJP corporator from Pune via video link from Delhi, during the party\'s \'\'Mera Booth Sabse Mazboot\'\' programme.']"

Ten years back, we used to have a tough time convincing people to contest on our ticket,"" a BJP state unit leader said, adding that a section of leaders has appealed to the central leadership to ensure that old timers don\'t feel sidelined.The state unit, in consultation with the central leaders, has roped in an external agency to assess its prospects in the Lok Sabha constituencies, he said.BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya told PTI that a candidate list will be prepared based on inputs by the external agency and the party\'s senior leaders.""We have launched both external and internal surveys to assess the winnability of seats and candidates.

He visited the neighbouring Rae Bareli constituency, represented in Lok Sabha by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in December.According to official sources, PM Modi will address a public meeting in Kauhar area of Gauriganj and will launch some projects besides laying the foundation stone of a new unit of the Munshiganj Ordnance Factory, where assault rifles will be made in collaboration with Russia, on Sunday.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited Amethi earlier this week to review preparations for the prime minister\'s visit.PM Modi previously visited Amethi on May 5, 2014 and the BJP, which had fielded party leader Smriti Irani against Rahul Gandhi in 2014 general election, had managed three lakh votes.Ms Irani has been camping in the constituency since and is expected to contest again in the coming poll, expected to be held in April-May.State BJP general secretary Govind Narain Shukla, who is the convenor of the prime minister\'s public meeting, said, ""It will be a historic meeting in Kauhar with over 1.25 lakh people likely to attend it.""In 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the BJP had won four of the five assembly constituencies under Amethi Lok Sabha seat, with SP winning one.Meanwhile, Congress workers have objected to the white-washing of the wall paintings of their leader, Rahul Gandhi, near the meeting venue.1 COMMENTMr Gandhi\'s representative, Chandrakant Dubey, said white-washing the paintings of the local MP was ""very sad and unfortunate"" and only shows the intolerance of BJP leaders and workers.']"

In the 2017 assembly elections, the Congress lost all four assembly seats it had under the Lok Sabha constituency, the BJP had won three of them.Ms Irani got a pat on the back from the Prime Minister today.

"['New Delhi:Union minister VK Singh today started a chain reaction when he suggested ""crowdsourcing"" to track what he called the ""lies"" of Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. The rivalry between the Congress and the BJP, which sharpened since as the national elections got closer, has peaked since the terror attack at Jammu and Kashmir\'s Pulwama. The Congress has criticised the government\'s handling of the matter, and accused the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of politicising the issue.Today, Union Minister VK Singh, who is also a former soldier, tweeted: ""Now this one is really interesting. Let\'s crowdsource all the lies. Tag three people you know, who will share with you a @RahulGandhi lie.""The tweet was accompanied by a hashtag -- #RahulGandhiLieChallenge and tagged Union ministers Rajyavardhan Rathore and Jayant Sinha and senior party leader Anurag Thakur.One of them responded immediately. Mr Singh\'s cabinet colleague Rajyavardhan Rathore, another former soldier and Olympian, posted a comment, accompanied by a video clipping:Hardly a challenge to catch Rahul Gandhi lying, @Gen_VKSingh sir,but accepted!Here\'s when he claimed Rafale offsets of 1.3 L crores,when deal itself is 58k crores!I nominate @PiyushGoyal ji, @manojtiwariMP ji, @kirenrijiju ji#RahulGandhiLieChallengehttps://t.co/G047tMXLKmhttps://t.co/dzzdVU7ftb— Rajyavardhan Rathore (@Ra_THORe) March 3, 2019Later in the evening, Jayant Sinha responded:Sh. @RahulGandhi ji,Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earth\'s crust.Not by peddling lies.Sharing the video to help recall.I nominate @myogiadityanath ji, @dasraghubar ji and @PemaKhanduBJP ji#RahulGandhiLieChallengehttps://t.co/CssO19TqhNpic.twitter.com/yistZmIcpE— Jayant Sinha (@jayantsinha) March 3, 2019The Congress is yet to respond to the matter.28 COMMENTSFor months, the BJP and the Congress have been exchanging tit-for-tat allegations of lying over the government\'s deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets.']"
"['Ahmedabad:The Gujarat Congress will not project any one leader as the party\'s future face as it does not believe in running the show with one or two leaders like the BJP, state party in-charge Rajiv Satav has said.But, he did not rule out fielding young leaders who emerged in the last few years, like Patidar quota agitation spearhead Hardik Patel, in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.The party is ready to take on the BJP in Gujarat, Mr Satav told PTI in an interview, adding that selection of candidates is underway and an announcement will be made soon.""Our policy is not to project one leader and go with him. We believe in taking everybody together,"" he said, when asked if the Congress plans to make a leader like 25-year-old Hardik Patel the party\'s future face.He said like the 2017 Gujarat Assembly election, the Congress will give a ""big surprise"" to the BJP in the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha poll.While the Congress failed to win any Lok Sabha seat in 2014, it bagged 77 out of the total 182 Assembly seats in the 2017 state polls, considerably improving its performance but missing the victory target by 15 seats.Mr Satav, the Lok Sabha member from Maharashtra, said Congress chief Rahul Gandhi believes in giving chance to young leaders. He has given opportunity to many young leaders like Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia. ""But, there are senior leaders whose experience and leadership matters.""""If you see the BJP, it is a party of two leaders. The chief minister here (in Gujarat) has no say, while the deputy chief minister is nowhere to be seen,"" he claimed.Since 1995, the Congress fared badly in election after election in Gujarat, which was once its stronghold. But after 2015, leaders like Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakor emerged in the state.Alpesh Thakor earlier joined the Congress. Jignesh Mevani is an Independent MLA from Vadgam with Congress\' support while Hardik Patel is yet to take a decision on joining the party.Asked if the Congress was willing to give a chance to these leaders in the Lok Sabha polls, Mr Satav said, ""We will take along all those who believe in our ideology.""He said the Congress was gearing up to give a tough fight to the BJP in all 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state.""Before 2017 (Assembly polls), nobody believed we could make huge gains in Gujarat. We almost doubled our seats in the last state polls. This time, the Lok Sabha poll results will also be different,"" he said.He said Rahul Gandhi will pursue an extensive campaign like the way he did before the last assembly polls and is likely to address more than six rallies in the state.""The 2017 Gujarat polls broke the perception that the BJP can\'t be defeated. Though the Congress fell short of a majority, people of the state gave ample love to Rahul Gandhi as we were able to increase our tally from 43 to 77,"" he said.""After the 2017 Gujarat polls, we defeated the BJP in every state poll we fought. It started from here,"" he claimed.On charge that the Congress was creating caste and class divide for poll gains, he said, ""When the BJP is losing and we are gaining, they will make such baseless allegations.""1 COMMENT""Modi made big promises but failed to deliver. When he became the prime minister, it was expected the state will have rapid development but nothing happened. Bringing international leaders on the Sabarmati river banks will not yield anything,"" Mr Satav quipped.']"

He had later said that his minister alone provided 1 crore jobs.4 COMMENTSWith inputs from PTI']"
"['Dhule (Maharashtra):Congress chief Rahul Gandhi today accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of not taking a break from public relations exercises even at a time when India-Pakistan relations were at their lowest point in decades, news agency PTI has reported.""The Indian Prime Minister can\'t keep his public relations (exercises) aside even for five minutes, and that\'s the difference between him and us,"" PTI quoted Mr Gandhi as saying at a rally in Maharashtra\'s Dhule. ""He tells the media that India is united after the Pulwama terror attacks, but then immediately targets the Congress.""According to the news agency, Mr Gandhi also accused PM Modi of misusing solemn occasions to target the Congress. ""He did the same (engage in PR exercises) at the war memorial opening,"" Gandhi said, referring to the Prime Minister\'s criticism of the opposition party during the opening ceremony of the National War Memorial in Delhi recently.The Congress chief asserted that his response to the Pulwama attack was very different. ""After the incident took place, I appealed to all partyworkers to not politicise the issue because it was important for us to be united at that time of crisis,"" he said, claiming that the BJP ""spreads hatred and violence"" wherever it goes.The Congress chief also accused PM Modi of ""protecting"" the likes of fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi, who is wanted by multiple agencies in India for loan fraud. ""Modi refers to Mehul Choksi as Mehul bhai (brother Mehul) but calls you -- the people --mitron (friends),"" Mr Gandhi said, alleging that the Prime Ministerwas biased towards the former.The opposition has repeatedly accused the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the centre of ""politicising"" the India-Pakistan situation for gains in the Lok Sabha elections, set to be held before May. A recent remark by Karnataka party leader BS Yeddyurappa that India\'s air strike on the Balakot terror camp will help the BJP win over 22 of the 28 seats in the state further strengthened their claim.PM Modi has been under attack from the opposition since February 14, when 40 CRPF soldiers died at the hands of a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber in Jammu and Kashmir\'s Pulwama. The Congress claimd that the Prime Minister was shooting for a ""self-promotional"" documentary at the Corbett National Park back then, and had continued even after hearing about the incident. The allegation was denied by the centre.Even on Thursday, various political leaders criticised the Prime Minister for organising a mega-video conference with crores of BJP workers at a time when Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was in the custody of Pakistan authorities. ""I wud urge the PM to postpone this. At this moment, we as a nation, need to spend all our energies and time to get the IAF pilot back safely and to sternly deal wid Pak (sic),"" Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted.Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was handed over by Pakistan to India this evening and crossed the Attari-Wagah border around 9:20 pm.120 COMMENTS(With inputs from PTI)']"
"['Bhopal:A Congress legislator in Madhya Pradesh has courted controversy by refusing to recite Vande Mataram citing that it violated the tenets of Islamic Sharia law.Bhopal (Central) MLA Arif Masood refused to recite Vande Mataram at a public gathering of the India Mev Mahasabha at Shyampur in the Madhya Pradesh\'s Sehore district on Tuesday.The speaker before him at the function, former BJP legislator Ramesh Saxena had started and concluded his speech with ""Vande Mataram"" and ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" chants.Mr Masood, who took the stage next, however, said he would not chant Vande Mataram as the Sharia did not permit it.""See the books of the Mev community. Several warriors who laid down their lives for the country are mentioned in them. We are laying down our lives for the country today, and will do so tomorrow,"" Mr Masood said.""But it is regrettable that we have to prove our commitment by raising Vande Mataram slogans,"" he added by way of his defence.Talking to the media later, Mr Masood said India was recognised all over the world because its people had religious freedom.""Why should I sing (Vande Mataram). I follow Shariat, which does not permit this. I am ready to lay my life for the country, ready to go to the border. But, they insist on singing Vande Mataram. Our army fights at the border, not leaders,"" the Congress MLA said.Reacting to Mr Masood\'s statement, BJP\'s Ramesh Saxena said, ""After speaking, I left the venue so I don\'t know what Mr Masood said in his speech. This might be his personal opinion,"" Mr Saxena said.The Madhya Pradesh Congress also said it did not agree with Arif Masood and said the party would continue to recite Vande Mataram.""Whatever Arif Masood has said is his personal opinion based on Shariat. The Congress has utmost respect for Vande Mataram, which the party would continue to recite. We do not agree with his thoughts,"" Narendra Saluja, coordinator of state Congress media cell, said.The BJP later demanded that the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker seek a clarification from Arif Masood, as Vande Mataram is the national song of India.""The Congress MLA has refused to sing Vande Mataram, which is our national song. He took the oath to protect the country\'s sovereignty and integrity. The Vidhan Sabha speaker should serve him notice to seek (his) response,"" said Rahul Kothari, state BJP spokesperson, adding that the Congress always protected such leaders. COMMENTMeanwhile, as part of a tradition, Chief Minister Kamal Nath recited Vande Mataram on Friday, the first day of the month, in a park outside the state secretariat.']"
