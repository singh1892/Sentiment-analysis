On its return journey, the chair car ticket will cost ₹1,795 and the executive car ticket will be priced at ₹3,470, they said. While the chair car fares are 1.5 times the price of Shatabdi trains running the same distance, the executive class fares are 1.4 times of first class air conditioned seating in the premium train, the official sources said. The semi-high speed train is scheduled to be flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 15. The train has two classes of tickets — executive class and chair car — and will have differently priced meals, the sources said. While passengers travelling from New Delhi to Varanasi in the executive class will be charged ₹399 for morning tea, breakfast and lunch, travellers in the chair car will need to pay ₹344 for the same. Those travelling from New Delhi to Kanpur and Prayagraj will have to pay ₹155 and ₹122 for executive class and chair car, respectively. From Varanasi to New Delhi, the passengers will be charged ₹349 and ₹288 in the executive class and chair, respectively. \\\\n']\",\n",
       " \"['\\\\nAll the major Opposition parties on Monday converged at Andhra Bhawan, where Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu along with all his legislators, MPs and Ministers sat down on a 12-hour fast protesting against the Narendra Modi government’s failure to deliver the promised special status to the State. This was the second time the Opposition got together in a month.The last such gathering was at a rally by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata protesting against the CBI’s alleged misconduct.Left skip eventThe CPI and the CPI (M) skipped the event since they are part of the Pawan Kalyan-led front against the TDP in Andhra Pradesh.Opening the day-long protest for justice, Mr. Naidu said Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not follow “raj dharma.” “Atal Bihari Vajpayee said ‘raj dharma’ was not followed in Gujarat (during the 2002 riots). Now, raj dharma is not being followed in the case of Andhra Pradesh. We have been denied what was rightfully ours,” he said.The Andhra CM alleged that Mr. Modi was “unfit” to rule the country and that he went to Guntur in Andhra Pradesh “only to rub salt into our wounds.”“On behalf of five crore people of Andhra, I am warning this government... I came here to remind you of the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act,” he said.Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who was one of the first Opposition leaders to visit the fast venue, said the Prime Minister had made a habit of lying on the special status. “He goes to Andhra Pradesh, he lies about the special status. He goes to the North-East, he tells another lie over there. He has absolutely got no credibility left,” Mr. Gandhi said.Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien said the No-Confidence Motion moved by the TDP had brought the Opposition together. “This is not a fight of any one political party, it is not a fight of the TDP or TMC alone. This is a fight to save the Constitution, to save secularism and to save the nation,” he said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said: “One may have voted for any party but after elections, whoever wins and becomes the CM, is the CM of the entire State and not of a particular party. Similarly, when one becomes the PM, then he is the PM of the entire country, not just one party. The way PM Modi treats governments of Opposition parties in States, he behaves like he is not the PM of India but the PM of Pakistan.”Mr. Naidu was seen showing the clippings of his exchanges with Mr. Modi in Andhra Pradesh to all the political leaders who came. National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah said the Prime Minister had stooped so low as to make personal remarks against Mr. Naidu. “The Jammu-Srinagar highway is closed for six days. They cannot clear the 30km road, but they want to rule the country,” he added.Just cause, says DMKStating that Mr. Naidu was fighting for a just cause, DMK leader Siva said the Modi government would be ousted in three months. He also reminded the gathering that Mr. Naidu had played a vital role in the earlier coalition governments. “The powers of the State are being encroached upon,” he said.Loktantrik Janata Dal chief Sharad Yadav said the Modi-Shah claim that the Opposition has no prime ministerial face is grounded in ignorance. “In 1996 or 1989 we did not have any prime ministerial face and yet we managed to win the election and find a credible candidate,” he added.Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Ahmed Patel and Jairam Ramesh were also at the venue to express their support. Among others who met Mr. Naidu were former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, NCP’s Majeed Memon, JD (S) chief Deve Gowda, Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav and BJP rebel Shatrughan Sinha.On Tuesday, Mr. Naidu, along with ministers, MPs and legislators, will march from Andhra Bhawan to Jantar Mantar before meeting President of India Ram Nath Kovind at noon.\\\\n']\",\n",
       " \"['\\\\nThe controversies surrounding the Rafale deal is a non-issue for the Indian voter who is likely to retain full faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership in the upcoming Lok Sabha election, Finance, Corporate Affairs, Coal and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal said in the wake of the fresh revelations by The Hindu on “parallel negotiations” by the PMO in the €7.87 billion deal.Speaking to the press in the financial capital on Saturday, Mr. Goyal said insinuations and allegations of corruption and cronyism in the deal were only a figment of the Opposition’s imagination and had no basis whatsoever in reality. \\\\n\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefence Ministry protested against PMO undermining Rafale negotiations \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n“They can [Opposition] show whichever documents they want, but the people of India have full faith in the leadership provided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At the least, the allegations are only keeping the Opposition busy and away from the real issues of public interest,” the Minister said in reaction to a question if the controversial Rafale deal will impact the Bharatiya Janata Party’s chances in the elections. “This is and will be a non-issue for the voters,” he said.According to a recent report in The Hindu, at height of the negotiations over the controversial €7.87-billion Rafale deal between India and France, the Defence Ministry had raised strong objections to “parallel negotiations” conducted by the Prime Minister\\\\'s Office with the French side. The Opposition has since alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had consistently undermined the Air Force and Defence Ministry to benefit his “cronies” in the Rafale deal. Talks on with Sena Mr. Goyal, who was speaking on the sidelines of the party programme to launch the Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat initiative in Maharashtra, said the consultations with the Shiv Sena for an alliance in the State were going on and could come to a conclusion soon. Alluding to the demands for simultaneous elections, the Minister said it cannot be selectively applied to Maharashtra and Mr. Modi would only look to move in that direction if there was a national consensus on it.  Objecting to West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee’s alleged efforts to disturb BJP’s poll preparations in the State, Mr. Goyal said the anarchy created by the Trinamool leaders was condemnable. They blocked preparations for even the Prime Minister’s rallies while not making arrangements for lakhs of voters who wanted to come and hear him talk, Mr. Goyal claimed.\\\\n']\",\n",
       " \"['\\\\nAlways in campaign mode, distinguishing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech in Parliament from one outside is not easy. Delivering what could be his last speech to the 16th Lok Sabha, Mr. Modi set the tone for his campaign for the 17th Lok Sabha election that he hopes to win and retain power. The speech was Classic Modi vintage. But he added some rhyme to rhetoric in the latest, and it will be interesting to watch whether that continues. Here are the five features of Mr. Modi’s speech template.\\\\n\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt’s 55 months of service vs 55 years, says Narendra Modi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1) Mr. Modi refers to himself in third person: For some curious reasons, Mr. Modi repeatedly refers to himself in third person. ‘Fraudsters are scared of Modi,’ ‘Modi is this..’ ‘Modi has done that.’ He named himself multiple times on Thursday. Incidentally, US President Donald Trump also refers to himself in third person. “Modi, Modi..” the treasury benches cheered as he concluded.2) Mr. Modi presents himself as the poor man from the margins who has trumped a corrupt dynasty. The PM mentioned his own humble origins and sought to contrast it with the dynasty, meaning the Nehru-Gandhi family. Without naming Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s husband Robert Vadra, Mr. Modi said properties amassed by some people were being unearthed from all over.3) Mr. Modi presents himself as a workaholic and epitome of purity. He claims to work round the clock, claims complete incorruptibility. This is an abiding feature of all his speeches, successful so far, in appealing to the reverence for asceticism steeped in Indian culture.4) Mr. Modi’s speeches compare the achievements of his tenure with those of all the previous governments, mostly of Congress. He perfected this art in the 2007 Gujarat state election. He frames the chronology to suit his speech. On Thursday, it was ‘my 55 months versus their 55 years.’ Then he reels off a lot numbers and figures, which cannot be immediately fact-checked. “Numbers don’t lie,” Mr. Modi added today for effect.5) The most consequential part of a Modi speech is his ability and willingness to repackage any criticism of his style and substance into a criticism of the country in an oratorial sleight of hand, and insinuate that his critics are being anti-national. He did that with impressive effectiveness on Thursday. He accused his opponents of questioning the majesty of the CBI, the ECI, the RBI, the judiciary etc all of which have faced questions of probity and autonomy. Mr. Modi particularly drilled in his idea that raising questions about the military’s conduct amounted to harming the country. And that meshed well with his charge against foreign conspiracies against India. 20,000 NGOs that got foreign money have been shut, and more could be shut he declared.Mr. Modi has appealed to enough number of Indians to win a parliamentary majority in 2014. The electoral impact of his oratory and charisma is also contextual. The open question about 2019 is whether his speeches will have the same effect as they had in 2014.\\\\n']\",\n",
       " \"['\\\\nCongress president Rahul Gandhi launched a fresh offensive against Prime Narendra Modi over the Rafale deal on Thursday, even as his party brainstormed for three hours on a strategy to take on the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.“The Prime Minister is making long speeches, but he has stolen ₹30,000 crores from the defence forces of the country and given it to Mr. Anil Ambani. Listen to me carefully... the Prime Minister has personally taken ₹30,000 crore and given it to Mr. Anil Ambani,” an aggressive Congress president told reporters after a meeting of general secretaries and States-in-charge to review 2019 poll preparedness.His sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who has been made a general secretary for Uttar Pradesh (East), also attended her first official party meet.In a separate meeting held to discuss U.P. strategy, it was decided that Mr. Gandhi will accompany newly-appointed general secretaries for U.P. — Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Jyotiraditya Scindia — to Lucknow on Monday (February 11). A roadshow from the Lucknow airport to the Congress office has been planned.“The AICC general secretaries, Jyotiraditya Scindia ji and Priyanka ji, will interact with party workers and leaders on February 12, 13 and 14,” said K.C. Venugopal, general secretary in charge of Organisation.“Every day, the media is reporting something that the party is not aware of,” he said in a reference to earlier media reports about Ms. Vadra starting her U.P. innings with a visit to the Kumbh Mela.Inside the meeting, a source said, Ms Vadra admitted that a difficult assignment had been given to her, but assured the leadership that she would give it her best shot to win back support for the Congress in U.P. “She also said the party will continually work from the grassroots level until positive results are achieved,” said the source.In other important decisions, it was agreed that State-level alliances and the scrutiny of Lok Sabha candidates would be finalised by the end of February.Message to bureaucracyAt a convention organised by Congress’s minority cell, Mr. Gandhi said bureaucrats should work for the people of India, not any organisation, and alleged that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was trying to capture all important institutions across the country.He once again made a scathing attack on the Prime Minister, calling him a “coward.” The Congress chief challenged him to a debate on issues such as the Rafale deal, national security and the economy.“The RSS wants that the Constitution should be kept aside and the country should be run from Nagpur [RSS headquarters]. They put their people in the judicial system, Election Commission. If the CBI chief wants to start an inquiry against Mr. Modi, then the chief is replaced by their men. So their aim is to finish every institution.”The Congress chief alleged that in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where the BJP was in power for 15 years, bureaucracy had been filled with RSS loyalists.Earlier, at the convention, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev made a controversial statement that the “Modi government brought the triple talaq bill to harass Muslim men” and promised that a Congress government would undo it.\\\\n']\",\n",

       " '[\\'\\\\nCongress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday sent a letter of dissent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the government named 1983 batch IPS officer Rishi Kumar Shukla as the new chief of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Mr. Kharge, in his letter, has argued that the three member Selection Committee, that includes Prime Minister Modi and the Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, has diluted the principles laid down in Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act and the Vineet Naraian judgement.\"By including officers who do not have experience in investigating anti-corruption cases, the Committee is in violation of the DSPE Act and the Supreme Court judgements that guide the appointment of the Director, CBI,” Mr. Kharge said in his letter.He argued that officers were shortlisted \"on the basis of seniority, annual confidential reports (ACRs) and total experience in investigation and anti-corruption of 100 months or more.\" But the newly named CBI chief didn\\\\\\'t have any anti-corruption experience, claimed Mr. Kharge in his note whose contents have been accessed by The Hindu.\"All three aspects — seniority, integrity and experience in investigation of anti-corruption cases — should be given equal weightage to get the best suited officers in the shortlist,\" Mr. Kharge argued in his dissent note.\"Seniority cannot be the only criterion in an appointment to such a critical post and experience in anti-corruption cases and prior experience of having served the organization should also be considered seriously,\" he said in the note.A source familiar with the developments said though the government had shortlisted 16 officers, it was reduced to a panel of five names for consideration of the Selection Committee when it met on Friday.In the meeting, the Congress leader, representing Opposition parties, pointed out that Mr. Javed Ahmad, a 1984 Uttar Pradesh cadre officer, was best suited for the post.According to the Opposition leader, Mr. Ahmad, who had served in the CBI as a joint director earlier, had a total experience of 303 months, including 160 months of handling anti-corruption cases.This was the highest for any of the five officers under consideration. Two other officers – Rajiv Rai Bhatnagar, a 1983 UP cadre officer and Sudeep Lakhtakia of Telangana – also had some experience in handling anti-corruption assignments.\"It is important to restore the the image and integrity of the CBI as a premier institution that is fighting against corruption. Hence, prior experience of having serve the institution should be given primacy after having shortlisted candidates based on their seniority and their ACR,\" Mr. Kharge\\\\\\'s note argued.PTI adds:‘Kharge tried to manipulate CBI chief selection criteria’Mr. Kharge tried to “manipulate” the criteria for selection of CBI chief with the ulterior motive of accommodating officers of his choice in the short-list of candidates, Union Minister Jitendra Singh has claimed.He also hit out at Mr. Kharge for “giving his own version” of the panel’s deliberations to the media.“Kharge tried to manipulate the objective criteria, based on independent and impartial assessment, to select CBI Director...He wanted to include some officers of his preference in the short-list of candidates,” Mr. Singh, the Union Minister of State for Personnel, told PTI.The Minister said Justice Gogoi fully endorsed the objective criteria applied for selecting the head of the CBI.Mr. Singh, whose Ministry is the nodal department for the CBI, said the CBI Director’s selection was made in the objective criteria based on “seniority, service record and the experience in anti-corruption/investigation” areas.Mr. Singh said, “We have reasons to find fault in the manner Kharge is conducting himself in meeting after meeting violating all the norms of propriety by speaking to media and giving his own version of deliberations happening in the high-powered panel’s meet“.“Not only this, in his frequent comments to media, Kharge has gone to the extent of making unsavourily and sarcastic remarks against the prime minister and the government,” the Minister said.Mr. Singh said one should not forget how Mr. Kharge was accommodated in the three- member selection panel by the Modi government.“Established rules envisaged that the selection panel will have the Leader of Opposition (LoP) as one of the members. But as the Congress did not get enough numbers in the 2014 general elections (to be accorded the status), it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who went out of the way to include leader of Congress (the largest opposition party) in the panel... in order to add further transparency and ensure balance in the selection procedure,” he said.\\\\n\\']',\n",

Interim Budget a trailer for what will take India towards prosperity after Lok Sabha polls,” he said in a televised statement. Enumerating on the details of the Budget, Mr. Modi said more than 12 crore farmers, three crore middle class families and 30-40 crore workers employed in unorganised sector would benefit from the Budget, adding that poverty has been falling at a record rate due to the efforts of his government.Big boost“This Budget will boost the efforts of 130 crore citizens in realising the goal of a new India,” Mr. Modi said.He said the development initiatives of the NDA government have touched several lives, which have been reflected in the Budget proposals from farmer welfare to middle class, from income tax relief to infrastructure, from manufacturing to MSME, from housing to healthcare and from the increased pace of development to the New India.He congratulated the middle class for the relief in taxes and said he saluted it for its contribution towards the development of the nation.He said PM Kisan Nidhiwas a historic step for farmer welfare, which would help the farmers with less than five acres of land. He added that the animal husbandry and fisheries sectors have been taken care of in the Budget.Underlining the importance of safeguarding the interests of the unorganised sector, he said Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Man Dhan Yojanawould be of great help. This sector needed more safeguarding of their interests and the Budget had done so, he said.Finance Minister Piyush Goyal’s maiden Budget speech ran to over an hour and forty minutes.Rajnath cheerleadsAs he began his speech, it was Home Minister Rajnath Singh who urged treasury benchers to thump their desks in support, for the acting Finance Minister, thrust into an unfamiliar role. Mr. Modi, too, was seen thumping his desk in encouragement at some of the early rhetorical flourishes of the speech, with other BJP MPs yelling “wah, wah”.These were just early hiccups, with Mr. Goyal gaining confidence with each announcement, as he unveiled one sop after another for farmers, unorganised sector workers, and finally the tax proposals.The tax exemption announcements prompted the treasury benches to burst out into a chant of “Modi! Modi!” for nearly two minutes before order could be restored. The only light interjection on Mr. Goyal’s behalf was the mention that he had watched the film Urion the 2016 surgical strike across the border, just before he announced some sops for the Indian film industry.\\\\n']\",\n",

The court has posted the matter for February 11 when the statement of other witnesses will be recorded.Besides Vivek Doval, there are two other witnesses -- his friend Nikhil Kapoor and business partner Amit Sharma -- who will record their statements in support of the criminal defamation complaint.Mr. Doval in his complaint had said that the magazine and Mr. Ramesh had attempted to “deliberately malign and defame” him to “settle scores with his father.”The Caravan in its January 16 online write-up titled ‘The D Companies’ had said that Vivek Doval, “runs a hedge fund in the Cayman Islands” which is “an established tax haven” and was “registered merely 13 days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government demonetised all existing ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes, in 2016.”According to the complaint, Mr. Ramesh had held a press conference on January 17 reiterating the “baseless and unfounded facts” as narrated in the article. He had alleged that the contents of the article present “no illegality” on his part, but the entire narration has been presented in a manner, which suggests “wrongdoings” to the readers.With regard to Mr. Ramesh, the complaint said that the press conference addressed by him went “beyond the mere narration in the article” and that he was already geared and armed to launch an attack, “merely waiting for the publication of the article”, which could then provide a “smokescreen to the otherwise targeted and deliberate attack on the reputation of the complainant and his family.”It said the article has been used as a political tool to “foster in unscrupulous hands” to “seek vendetta and wreak vengeance.” It also said that the very act of setting up and launching of a hedge fund, whether in the Cayman Islands or any other place in the world, is not by itself an illegal and unlawful act.“However, the same, even without explicitly so stating, has been portrayed in a manner that leads to the very setting up and launching of the hedge fund being perceived as an unlawful act,” it said.The complaint alleged that “a web of conjectures and surmises has been devised by selective and careful nitpicking of random facts in respect of the complainant, his brother and his father — the facts being completely unrelated to one another — and presenting them in a manner that hints at deep rooted conspiracies between the family members, in carrying out laundering of black money, by rerouteing of funds into India through the Cayman Islands, in the post-demonetization era”.\\\\n']\",\n",

Israel is scheduled to hold general elections on April 9 and India is expected to start its election schedule in April as well.Sources working on the Korean visit said its “exact contours are still being worked out”, but the Prime Minister is expected to make a short trip to the Republic of Korea (RoK, or South Korea) towards the end of February. This will be his second visit to Seoul after May 2015. The trip will also follow the bilateral visit by South Korean President Moon Jae-In to India in July 2018. In October 2018, the Seoul Peace Prize Cultural Foundation announced that it would award Mr. Modi with its annual Peace Prize. The foundation, that has a selection committee comprising 1,300 Korean academics and former diplomats, has selected German Chancellor Angela Merkel, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and former Czech President Vaclav Havel in the past for the honour. While the award ceremony is linked to the Prime Minister’s visit for bilateral talks, officials said the Foundation was not linked to the South Korean government.“The Foundation that awards this prize is totally independent, and even the government (of South Korea) learnt about the award only after the announcement, so they are not connected,” Ambassador to India Shin Bong-Kil told The Hindu in an interview last November.

We have committed that in 2019, we will have a government that will make up for all the crimes that Narendra Modi has done against farmers in five years,” he said.Assures passage of Women’s Reservation BillThe Congress president said the Women’s Reservation Bill would be passed on a priority if the party was voted to power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“The first thing we will do when we win the 2019 election is to pass the Women’s Reservation Bill in the Parliament,” he said.He was responding to a suggestion from a party worker on the need for more women candidates.“We want to see women in position of leadership,” he added.The bill seeking to reserve 33% of seats in Parliament and legislature has been pending for a long time in view of lack of consensus.Sabarimala issueRefraining from directly commenting on the sensitive Sabarimala temple issue, wherein the Supreme Court had permitted entry of women of all age groups into the Lord Ayyappa temple, he merely said the party respects the traditions of Kerala.“Congress party respects women of Kerala and at the same time respects the traditions of Kerala. We do not agree with the violence carried out by the BJP and CPI(M) in the State,” he said.The 69 day annual pilgrimage season in Sabarimala, which ended on January 20, had witnessed widespread protests from devotees and right wing groups.This was over the CPI(M)-led LDF government’s decision to implement the September 28 Apex Court verdict, allowing women of all ages to enter the shrine.‘Shakti’ programmeThe Congress president referred to Kerala as not just a State, but an ‘idea’.“It is a way of looking at the world that includes compassion, humility, respect. People of Kerala are helping guide the people of India,” he said.“Don’t think less of yourself. RSS has cadres, CPI(M) has cadres, but India lives in the hearts of Congress workers’, he told the gathering.Mr. Gandhi alleged that the CPI(M) and BJP work on ‘dividing’ the people of Kerala and said the real issue of jobs and protection of farmers was put on the back burner.He also flayed the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax.Mr. Gandhi told the Congress workers that the party had launched a ‘shakti’ programme in which all workers could directly talk to the leadership.“Want every single Congress worker to feel ‘Ente booth, ente abhimaan, ente party’ [My booth, my pride, my party].”\\\\n']\",\n",

High, sir” – before chants of “Modi, Modi” reverberated across the stadium.A quick sampling of student responses in the online contest revealed a plethora of Modi fans.“I read Pradhan Mantriji’s book before my 10th board exams last year. It helped enhance my concentration and confidence,” said Twinkle Sharma, a Class 11 student of Indraprastha Public School in Mavikala, a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat district. Other students at the event had written essays on how the PM’s book honed their time management skills, clarified their life goals and eased stress for them and their parents.In fact, a good chunk of the PM’s remarks at the event seemed to be addressed to the parents. “Parents should not treat their children’s report cards as their visiting cards,” said Mr. Modi, warning that expecting children to fulfil parents’ dreams would only add an unhealthy dose of extra pressure.He also encouraged them to spend time listening to their children to stave off depression and to recognise that a holistic education could not be reduced to high marks and top ranks.Most students had memorised their prepared questions, several of which were prefaced with praise for the Prime Minister. “What motivates you to be energetic and tirelessly enthusiastic in your 17-hour hectic work schedule? As students, how can we also do proper time management schedules in accomplishing our goals?” asked Narendran, from Pollachi, Tamil Nadu.Throughout the two-hour interaction, Mr. Modi peppered his responses with self-help advice and patriotic mantras about serving the nation. He delighted students with his reference to current pop culture, when a parent complained that her child was obsessed with online games. “PUBG wala hai kya?” he asked, referring to the popular online game Players Unknown Battle Grounds. “Don’t let Playstation make you forget the playing field.”PTI adds: “Only when you take it in spirit and encourage your child, a 60% holder move towards 70 or 80%. If you only criticise and scold your child for not getting 90%, you will demotivate your child to start believing that they are incapable. This will take their grades further down towards 40%.“If parents start comparing their child with achievement of others, it disappoints the child. Parents should encourage their children for every small improvement,” the Prime Minister added.‘Observe and be curious’Mr. Modi said at present, the education system has become rank-bound and rather than running behind ranks, parents and teachers should teach the students to learn from things around them.“Live freely, observe and be curious to know new things rather than focussing on achieving only ranks. These days the meaning of education has narrowed down to getting ranks in exam for many,” he said.With less than a month to go for the class 10 and class 12 examinations, Mr. Modi discussed ways to handle the exam stress in the interactive session at the Talkatora Stadium where students from across the country got a chance to participate.“Our learning cannot be reduced to exams only. Our education must equip us to face various challenges of life as well. I sincerely believe that anything that challenges us, polishes us too. If there is nothing to test us, then we become complacent. There must always be something to challenge us,” he said.‘You are your own competition’Jairpeet Singh, a student based in Tehran, asked the Prime Minister about the need to encourage schoolchildren constantly and how it makes them happy.“Compare yourself with your old records, you are your own competition, you break your records, you will never have the chance to drown in a trough of despair if you break your records yourself,” the Prime Minister replied.“Exams are important in life, but one should not be stressed by it. Ask yourselves if this is an exam of your life or is it just an exam for a particular grade like class 10 or 12. Once you know the answer to this, your pressure will reduce,” he added.The Prime Minister advised the students to aim big in life, but do not get carried away in the process of realising them.“While aiming big in life is good, but don’t get so carried away by it that your dreams remain dreams and you become too old just thinking about it. We must understand ourselves. We must be true to ourselves, question ourselves frequently to see how we stand periodically as compared to our ambitions and dreams in life.“If you see yourself far from it, then you know what to do. You must break your dreams into phases and give it a time frame to achieve. You must cross one milestone at a time. Climb from a smaller peak to a larger one,” Mr. Modi said.‘Analyse your passion’Talking about depression Mr. Modi said, “Students living in hostel can also find some senior or a person with whom they can share their feelings. Parents should try to connect their child with someone who can help their child in the time of crisis or need. A get-together once in a weekend will also help.”When a student asked how they should convince their parents that they want to follow a passion of their own choice, he said, “Analyse your passion and figure out if you have the ability and a plan to follow it. Take guidance from your teachers. Then convince your parents and assure them that you can do it.”\\\\n']\",\n",

The Trinamool government does not touch a project unless there is a syndicate involved in it or they have no opting of receiving a kickback; this is an anti-development government,” Mr. Modi said.“Every child knows that there is a thing called triple T in Bengal — Trinamool Tolabaji Tax — which every job aspirant has to pay,” Mr. Modi said at a rally in Durgapur in Bardhhaman district.

Regional parties should also understand the ground realities and make sacrifices to a certain extent. Excerpts from an interview:Prime Minister Narendra Modi has targeted the Opposition plans for an alliance as a choice between a majboot and majboor (strong and weak) government, besides describing Opposition unity as ‘comical’ and ‘opportunistic’.If the grand alliance can’t understand its problems and address them, there is no point in reacting to the criticism of Mr. Modi. People of the country want a stable government. With the polls to the Lok Sabha round the corner, leaders of the Opposition should sink their differences and provide a clear road map on how they plan to provide a stable government for five years and ensure good governance. Regional parties, which came together with an idea of fighting the threat to secular and democratic values should sit together and discuss the modalities of seat sharing with an open mind.

This development resulted in the coming together of the Samajwadi Party and the BSP in Uttar Pradesh and the Congress deciding to contest independently. I don’t consider this as a failure, but a significant political development, which created confidence in Mr. Modi to attack Opposition unity as a failed experiment.

But, the Congress is yet to warm to the idea of a united fight against the BJP.

The Congress president cited an email to claim the businessman was aware of the deal days before India and France signed it. “Purported email being referred by the Congress Party is regarding the discussion between Airbus and Reliance Defence regarding Civil &amp; Defence Helicopter Programs under ‘Make in India’,” a Reliance Defence spokesperson said in a statement.Mr.Gandhi released to the media an email dated March 28, 2015 purportedly written by Airbus executive Nicolas Chamussy to three recipients with the subject line “Ambani.” He claimed that the email showed Mr. Ambani visited then French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian’s office and mentioned an “MoU in preparation and the intention to sign during the PM visit (to France).” “The discussion on proposed MoU was clearly with reference to cooperation between Airbus Helicopter and Reliance. It had no connection whatsoever with Government to Government Agreement between France and India for 36 Rafale aircraft,” the Reliance Defence spokesperson said. It is in public domain that Airbus Helicopter has partnered with Mahindra for the Military Helicopter Programme, the spokesperson added.  “Also, for the record, the MoU for Rafale aircraft was signed between France and India on January 25, 2016 and not in April 2015.

The PMO refused the suggestion of an escrow account. Not only was there no sovereign guarantee from the French government but it now appears that the PMO also batted for no bank guarantees. All this to facilitate the loot of the Indian exchequer by the Prime Minister’s crony capitalist friend,” the party’s Polit Bureau said in a statement.BSP president Mayawati, a recent entrant to Twitter, tweeted: “Corruption &amp; corrupt defence deal, No problem! Chowkidar is important for the BJP/RSS, not his honesty?” She then said, “People of the country have to decide what to do with the “Chowkidar and his so-called honesty.”In a tweet tagging The Hindu’s report, Mr. Gandhi said, “NoMo anti-corruption clause. The Chowkidar himself opened the door to allow Anil Ambani to steal 30,000 Cr. from the IAF.”He later referred twice to the media report — first in his speech at the day-long fast by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu which he attended as a gesture of solidarity with the TDP, and later during the Congress’ road show with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Lucknow.“The Prime Minister became Prime Minister by saying he is going to fight corruption. Have you read The Hindu newspaper today, did you read The Hindu newspaper yesterday?... The Prime Minister has stolen from the people of Andhra Pradesh and he has given that money to Mr. Anil Ambani,” the Congress chief said.Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in a series of tweets said the Rafale deal was “unravelling faster than the government thought”.Pointing to the series reports in The Hindu, he said, “Now it is revealed that crucial changes were made to the clauses in the standard Defence Procurement Procedure. No sovereign guarantee, no bank guarantee, no escrow account, yet a huge amount was paid as advance.” No penalty clause for undue influence, no clause against agency commission, no clause for access to suppliers accounts and Dassault goes laughing all the way to the bank.”The Communist Party of India reiterated its demand for a probe by Joint Parliamentary panel in the light of the latest revelations.“The Hindu story has brought the Rafale deal in perspective of how PMO took upon itself not only to negotiate the deal but also to facilitate it by removing critical clauses. The government stands thoroughly exposed. The entire truth of this deal can be brought out only if it is probed by a joint Parliamentary Committee,” CPI leader D.

I was among very few Congress leaders who did not oppose bifurcation of the State, since the party had already taken the decision and it was in our manifesto. I had made a few suggestions on how to go about it. I don’t think these suggestions were even discussed. The manner and timing of bifurcation was not correct.So, why now?I waited till the very end. Those who are at the helm of affairs in Andhra Pradesh, they come from YSR Reddy stream. After his son formed a new party, these people continued to be there. Once Oommen Chandy came from Kerala as the general secretary in-charge of the State, I expected that he would restore the party and strengthen it in the State. I met Mr. Chandy and spoke to him on several instances but nothing happened. For all practical purposes the party does not exist in Andhra. People are questioning my timing because of the upcoming elections. But I have not decided to join this way or that. But if your voice is not heard in the party, your mails do not receive acknowledgement, your suggestions are not considered what is the point in remaining in such a party?Was it because of Congress president Rahul Gandhi did not meet you?During that time Rahul Gandhi was very busy making election tours. That is too petty a reason to leave a party that I have been in for 40 to 45 years. The basic reason for my quitting is because I did not see any intent to strengthen the party or to build it back. My problem is not with him but the people who are with him and handle the affairs of Andhra Pradesh. They led the party to total liquidation in Andhra.How do you see the prospects of the Congress in Andhra and rest of the nation?In Andhra, at least, I believe that Congress will get fewer votes than it got in 2014. As far as the rest of the nation is concerned, where there are regional parties, they will take care of the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah combine and wherever regional parties are not there, Congress will win by default. I wish the Congress well.Did you expect that party under Rahul Gandhi would change for better?When he became vice-president, I was there in Jaipur in January 2013. Even if he had implemented 60-70% of what he had promised in his speech, from then the Congress would have been in a much better position.\\\\n']\",\n",

He also pointed to reports showing unemployment in the country at a 45-year high as reflecting the government’s failure on the jobs front.“I think it’s an insult to the Indian farmer to turn around and tell him that you are going to give him ₹17 a day; there couldn’t have been bigger insult than this,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters. “And as far as jobs are concerned, everybody knows that we are on a 45-year-high of unemployment. So, there is complete failure on these two fronts,” he added.“The surgical strike is going to happen on Mr. Modi in the next two months,” the Congress leader said, when asked if the budget proposals were a ‘surgical strike’ by the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the gegeneral elections. “There is going to be one surgical strike after the other: on Rafale, on demonetisation, on jobs and agriculture,” Mr. Gandhi asserted.“My one line comment on the Budget is that it was not a Vote on Account but an Account for Votes,” former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said.He also pointed out that the budget document was silent on jobs, education and described the income tax sops for the middle class as ‘mere’ tweaking of slabs.The former Finance Minister said the Congress party’s promise of a minimum income guarantee could not be compared with the government’s assured income support that he likened to an offer of ‘half a cup of tea’.“Please do not compare this ‘half a cup of tea scheme’, for what we have in mind is relief to every poor household so that every poor household comes up to a level of minimum income,” he said, referring to the Congress’s promise of a minimum income guarantee.Mr. Chidambaram also promised a ‘better designed tax architecture’.“We have always pleaded for a completely new direct taxes code which will completely redesign the architecture of income tax. So, our outlook is a far more reformist outlook and you will see that if and when the Congress Party is voted to power and we present our statement of intent and policy,” he said.\\\\n']\",\n",

And the answer is that the Prime Minister of India is corrupt,” he said.The Congress has been targeting Mr. Modi on the deal alleging that the price of each aircraft was sharply hiked from around ₹526 crore, negotiated under the deal during UPA, to ₹1,600 crore and that the contract would help Mr. Anil Ambani get ₹30,000 crore benefit through offset contract.The government has denied the charges and has accused the Congress of spreading ‘falsehood’ on the issue.Mr. Gandhi questioned the removal of the CBI chief even after the Supreme Court reinstated him and alleged that the Prime Minister did it to “protect himself” and “ensure that no enquiry is carried out” against him in the Rafale deal.“Why did the ex-President of France tell the press clearly that he was told by the Indian Prime Minister to give the Rafale contract to Mr. Anil Ambani? I want to ask why was a man who has no experience in building an aircraft given a contract after it was snatched away from those people [Hindustan Aeronautical Limited], who are building the aircraft for 70 years?” Mr. Gandhi asked.The Congress president said thousands of young Indians who could have got high paid jobs in HAL have now ‘lost the opportunity’.No defence capabilities were going to be built in India due to Mr. Modi’s actions, he alleged.\\\\n']\",\n",

We have committed that in 2019, we will have a government that will make up for all the crimes that Narendra Modi has done against farmers in five years,” he said.Assures passage of Women’s Reservation BillThe Congress president said the Women’s Reservation Bill would be passed on a priority if the party was voted to power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“The first thing we will do when we win the 2019 election is to pass the Women’s Reservation Bill in the Parliament,” he said.He was responding to a suggestion from a party worker on the need for more women candidates.“We want to see women in position of leadership,” he added.The bill seeking to reserve 33% of seats in Parliament and legislature has been pending for a long time in view of lack of consensus.Sabarimala issueRefraining from directly commenting on the sensitive Sabarimala temple issue, wherein the Supreme Court had permitted entry of women of all age groups into the Lord Ayyappa temple, he merely said the party respects the traditions of Kerala.“Congress party respects women of Kerala and at the same time respects the traditions of Kerala. We do not agree with the violence carried out by the BJP and CPI(M) in the State,” he said.The 69 day annual pilgrimage season in Sabarimala, which ended on January 20, had witnessed widespread protests from devotees and right wing groups.This was over the CPI(M)-led LDF government’s decision to implement the September 28 Apex Court verdict, allowing women of all ages to enter the shrine.‘Shakti’ programmeThe Congress president referred to Kerala as not just a State, but an ‘idea’.“It is a way of looking at the world that includes compassion, humility, respect. People of Kerala are helping guide the people of India,” he said.“Don’t think less of yourself. RSS has cadres, CPI(M) has cadres, but India lives in the hearts of Congress workers’, he told the gathering.Mr. Gandhi alleged that the CPI(M) and BJP work on ‘dividing’ the people of Kerala and said the real issue of jobs and protection of farmers was put on the back burner.He also flayed the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax.Mr. Gandhi told the Congress workers that the party had launched a ‘shakti’ programme in which all workers could directly talk to the leadership.“Want every single Congress worker to feel ‘Ente booth, ente abhimaan, ente party’ [My booth, my pride, my party].”\\\\n']\",\n",

The PMO refused the suggestion of an escrow account. Not only was there no sovereign guarantee from the French government but it now appears that the PMO also batted for no bank guarantees.

Chowkidar is important for the BJP/RSS, not his honesty?” She then said, “People of the country have to decide what to do with the “Chowkidar and his so-called honesty.”In a tweet tagging The Hindu’s report, Mr. Gandhi said, “NoMo anti-corruption clause. The Chowkidar himself opened the door to allow Anil Ambani to steal 30,000 Cr. from the IAF.”He later referred twice to the media report — first in his speech at the day-long fast by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu which he attended as a gesture of solidarity with the TDP, and later during the Congress’ road show with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Lucknow.“The Prime Minister became Prime Minister by saying he is going to fight corruption. Have you read The Hindu newspaper today, did you read The Hindu newspaper yesterday?... The Prime Minister has stolen from the people of Andhra Pradesh and he has given that money to Mr. Anil Ambani,” the Congress chief said.Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in a series of tweets said the Rafale deal was “unravelling faster than the government thought”.Pointing to the series reports in The Hindu, he said, “Now it is revealed that crucial changes were made to the clauses in the standard Defence Procurement Procedure. No sovereign guarantee, no bank guarantee, no escrow account, yet a huge amount was paid as advance.” No penalty clause for undue influence, no clause against agency commission, no clause for access to suppliers accounts and Dassault goes laughing all the way to the bank.”The Communist Party of India reiterated its demand for a probe by Joint Parliamentary panel in the light of the latest revelations.“The Hindu story has brought the Rafale deal in perspective of how PMO took upon itself not only to negotiate the deal but also to facilitate it by removing critical clauses. The government stands thoroughly exposed. The entire truth of this deal can be brought out only if it is probed by a joint Parliamentary Committee,” CPI leader D.

So their aim is to finish every institution.”The Congress chief alleged that in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where the BJP was in power for 15 years, bureaucracy had been filled with RSS loyalists.Earlier, at the convention, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev made a controversial statement that the “Modi government brought the triple talaq bill to harass Muslim men” and promised that a Congress government would undo it.\\\\n']\",\n",

The group does not support universal basic income or cash transfer schemes.Urgent reformsThe group has invited political parties to discuss the document on Friday. The Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal, and Nationalist Congress Party have so far agreed to participate.“We see the forthcoming Lok Sabha election as an opportunity to retrieve and, indeed, reclaim from manipulation and subversion, our legacy of the Republic. The situation today calls for urgent reforms in law, policies and institutions,” said the group, which is chaired by former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court A.P. Shah. Other members include Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav, economists Prabhat Patnaik and Jayati Ghosh, activist and former bureaucrat Harsh Mander, Public Health Foundation of India president K. Srinath Reddy and former West Bengal Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi.Charging the ruling NDA government with undermining the Constitution – “a liberal manifesto unlike any other” – and stifling dissent, former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court A.P. Shah said that the group’s suggestions were aimed at protecting constitutional safeguards, and starting the conversation on the practical policies needed to fulfil the promise of India’s foundational document.“In election season, public discourse is often reduced to mudslinging and seat share calculations,” said Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav. “At a time when the very foundation of our democracy are threatened, we want a discussion of actual issues and policies,” he said. Experts in 11 sub-committees drafted the group’s tasks, some of which come with detailed timelines for implementation, an approximation of costs involved and suggestions to raise resources. The section on employment, food, and social security, for example, would involve expenditure amounting to about 5% of GDP. Dr. Patnaik estimated that implementing all the proposals in the document might cost 10% of GDP. He pointed out that India’s tax revenue to GDP ratio was only 16% and could be increased.“These proposed policies and programmes are neither optional, nor unaffordable for an economy of our size…Additional costs involved can be mobilised with the help of small turnover tax, wealth tax and inheritance tax, besides doing away with many irrational corporate subsidies,” said the group’s statement.\\\\n']\",\n",

Two other officers – Rajiv Rai Bhatnagar, a 1983 UP cadre officer and Sudeep Lakhtakia of Telangana – also had some experience in handling anti-corruption assignments.\"It is important to restore the the image and integrity of the CBI as a premier institution that is fighting against corruption.

But as the Congress did not get enough numbers in the 2014 general elections (to be accorded the status), it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who went out of the way to include leader of Congress (the largest opposition party) in the panel... in order to add further transparency and ensure balance in the selection procedure,” he said.\\\\n\\']',\n",

Ms. Noor, the niece of legendary Congress leader A.B.A. Ghani Khan Choudhury, joined TMC on Monday and said that she “trusts Mamata Banerjee in her fight against communalism.” Her departure has dented the average Congress worker’s confidence.“Congress’ national leaders and possible coalition partners shared the stage with Mamata Banerjee about a week back. We never thought she would poach from the Congress after that January 19 rally but she did. It indicates how ruthless she is,” said one of Congress MLAs from Malda.MLAs from two Assembly segments under Malda-North Lok Sabha constituency joined the TMC over the last few months. One of them, Samar Mukherjee, was with the Congress; the other, Dipali Biswas, belonged to the CPI-M. “It had shaken the confidence of Noor,” said the MLA. Ms Noor was also the Malda district president of the Congress.One of the other factors for Ms Noor’s leaving the party is the BJP’s growth in parts of her constituency. The BJP had won six of Malda district’s 38 Zilla Parishad seats in the three-tier panchayat poll last year despite large scale violence. While the TMC’s seats went up from six (in 2013) to 30 (2018), the BJPs’ jumped from naught to six. Ms. Noor read the writing on the wall and left the party that was never defeated in Malda since 1980. “Huge turnout in Amit Shah’s meeting in her constituency earlier the month also disturbed her,” the MLA, known for his proximity to Ms Noor, said. Congress president Somendra Nath Mitra said that Ms Noor’s desertion will not affect the Congress’ poll prospects in anyway, indicating that the nephew of Ghani Khan Choudhury, Isha Khan Choudhury will be their candidate in Malda-North.

Regional parties should also understand the ground realities and make sacrifices to a certain extent. Excerpts from an interview:Prime Minister Narendra Modi has targeted the Opposition plans for an alliance as a choice between a majboot and majboor (strong and weak) government, besides describing Opposition unity as ‘comical’ and ‘opportunistic’.If the grand alliance can’t understand its problems and address them, there is no point in reacting to the criticism of Mr. Modi. People of the country want a stable government. With the polls to the Lok Sabha round the corner, leaders of the Opposition should sink their differences and provide a clear road map on how they plan to provide a stable government for five years and ensure good governance. Regional parties, which came together with an idea of fighting the threat to secular and democratic values should sit together and discuss the modalities of seat sharing with an open mind.

This development resulted in the coming together of the Samajwadi Party and the BSP in Uttar Pradesh and the Congress deciding to contest independently. I don’t consider this as a failure, but a significant political development, which created confidence in Mr. Modi to attack Opposition unity as a failed experiment.

This was the second time the Opposition got together in a month.The last such gathering was at a rally by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata protesting against the CBI’s alleged misconduct.Left skip eventThe CPI and the CPI (M) skipped the event since they are part of the Pawan Kalyan-led front against the TDP in Andhra Pradesh.Opening the day-long protest for justice, Mr. Naidu said Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not follow “raj dharma.” “Atal Bihari Vajpayee said ‘raj dharma’ was not followed in Gujarat (during the 2002 riots). Now, raj dharma is not being followed in the case of Andhra Pradesh. We have been denied what was rightfully ours,” he said.The Andhra CM alleged that Mr. Modi was “unfit” to rule the country and that he went to Guntur in Andhra Pradesh “only to rub salt into our wounds.”“On behalf of five crore people of Andhra, I am warning this government... I came here to remind you of the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act,” he said.Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who was one of the first Opposition leaders to visit the fast venue, said the Prime Minister had made a habit of lying on the special status. “He goes to Andhra Pradesh, he lies about the special status. He goes to the North-East, he tells another lie over there. He has absolutely got no credibility left,” Mr. Gandhi said.Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien said the No-Confidence Motion moved by the TDP had brought the Opposition together. “This is not a fight of any one political party, it is not a fight of the TDP or TMC alone. This is a fight to save the Constitution, to save secularism and to save the nation,” he said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said: “One may have voted for any party but after elections, whoever wins and becomes the CM, is the CM of the entire State and not of a particular party. Similarly, when one becomes the PM, then he is the PM of the entire country, not just one party. The way PM Modi treats governments of Opposition parties in States, he behaves like he is not the PM of India but the PM of Pakistan.”Mr. Naidu was seen showing the clippings of his exchanges with Mr. Modi in Andhra Pradesh to all the political leaders who came. National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah said the Prime Minister had stooped so low as to make personal remarks against Mr. Naidu. “The Jammu-Srinagar highway is closed for six days. They cannot clear the 30km road, but they want to rule the country,” he added.Just cause, says DMKStating that Mr. Naidu was fighting for a just cause, DMK leader Siva said the Modi government would be ousted in three months. He also reminded the gathering that Mr. Naidu had played a vital role in the earlier coalition governments. “The powers of the State are being encroached upon,” he said.Loktantrik Janata Dal chief Sharad Yadav said the Modi-Shah claim that the Opposition has no prime ministerial face is grounded in ignorance. “In 1996 or 1989 we did not have any prime ministerial face and yet we managed to win the election and find a credible candidate,” he added.Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Ahmed Patel and Jairam Ramesh were also at the venue to express their support. Among others who met Mr. Naidu were former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, NCP’s Majeed Memon, JD (S) chief Deve Gowda, Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav and BJP rebel Shatrughan Sinha.On Tuesday, Mr. Naidu, along with ministers, MPs and legislators, will march from Andhra Bhawan to Jantar Mantar before meeting President of India Ram Nath Kovind at noon.\\\\n']\",\n",

At the least, the allegations are only keeping the Opposition busy and away from the real issues of public interest,” the Minister said in reaction to a question if the controversial Rafale deal will impact the Bharatiya Janata Party’s chances in the elections. “This is and will be a non-issue for the voters,” he said.According to a recent report in The Hindu, at height of the negotiations over the controversial €7.87-billion Rafale deal between India and France, the Defence Ministry had raised strong objections to “parallel negotiations” conducted by the Prime Minister\\\\'s Office with the French side. The Opposition has since alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had consistently undermined the Air Force and Defence Ministry to benefit his “cronies” in the Rafale deal. Talks on with Sena Mr. Goyal, who was speaking on the sidelines of the party programme to launch the Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat initiative in Maharashtra, said the consultations with the Shiv Sena for an alliance in the State were going on and could come to a conclusion soon. Alluding to the demands for simultaneous elections, the Minister said it cannot be selectively applied to Maharashtra and Mr. Modi would only look to move in that direction if there was a national consensus on it.  Objecting to West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee’s alleged efforts to disturb BJP’s poll preparations in the State, Mr. Goyal said the anarchy created by the Trinamool leaders was condemnable. They blocked preparations for even the Prime Minister’s rallies while not making arrangements for lakhs of voters who wanted to come and hear him talk, Mr. Goyal claimed.\\\\n']\",\n",
       " \"['\\\\nAlways in campaign mode, distinguishing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech in Parliament from one outside is not easy. Delivering what could be his last speech to the 16th Lok Sabha, Mr. Modi set the tone for his campaign for the 17th Lok Sabha election that he hopes to win and retain power. The speech was Classic Modi vintage. But he added some rhyme to rhetoric in the latest, and it will be interesting to watch whether that continues. Here are the five features of Mr. Modi’s speech template.\\\\n\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt’s 55 months of service vs 55 years, says Narendra Modi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1) Mr. Modi refers to himself in third person: For some curious reasons, Mr. Modi repeatedly refers to himself in third person. ‘Fraudsters are scared of Modi,’ ‘Modi is this..’ ‘Modi has done that.’ He named himself multiple times on Thursday. Incidentally, US President Donald Trump also refers to himself in third person. “Modi, Modi..” the treasury benches cheered as he concluded.2) Mr. Modi presents himself as the poor man from the margins who has trumped a corrupt dynasty. The PM mentioned his own humble origins and sought to contrast it with the dynasty, meaning the Nehru-Gandhi family. Without naming Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s husband Robert Vadra, Mr. Modi said properties amassed by some people were being unearthed from all over.3) Mr. Modi presents himself as a workaholic and epitome of purity. He claims to work round the clock, claims complete incorruptibility. This is an abiding feature of all his speeches, successful so far, in appealing to the reverence for asceticism steeped in Indian culture.4) Mr. Modi’s speeches compare the achievements of his tenure with those of all the previous governments, mostly of Congress. He perfected this art in the 2007 Gujarat state election. He frames the chronology to suit his speech. On Thursday, it was ‘my 55 months versus their 55 years.’ Then he reels off a lot numbers and figures, which cannot be immediately fact-checked. “Numbers don’t lie,” Mr. Modi added today for effect.5) The most consequential part of a Modi speech is his ability and willingness to repackage any criticism of his style and substance into a criticism of the country in an oratorial sleight of hand, and insinuate that his critics are being anti-national. He did that with impressive effectiveness on Thursday. He accused his opponents of questioning the majesty of the CBI, the ECI, the RBI, the judiciary etc all of which have faced questions of probity and autonomy. Mr. Modi particularly drilled in his idea that raising questions about the military’s conduct amounted to harming the country. And that meshed well with his charge against foreign conspiracies against India. 20,000 NGOs that got foreign money have been shut, and more could be shut he declared.Mr. Modi has appealed to enough number of Indians to win a parliamentary majority in 2014. The electoral impact of his oratory and charisma is also contextual. The open question about 2019 is whether his speeches will have the same effect as they had in 2014.\\\\n']\",\n",

Listen to me carefully... the Prime Minister has personally taken ₹30,000 crore and given it to Mr. Anil Ambani,” an aggressive Congress president told reporters after a meeting of general secretaries and States-in-charge to review 2019 poll preparedness.His sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who has been made a general secretary for Uttar Pradesh (East), also attended her first official party meet.In a separate meeting held to discuss U.P. strategy, it was decided that Mr. Gandhi will accompany newly-appointed general secretaries for U.P. — Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Jyotiraditya Scindia — to Lucknow on Monday (February 11). A roadshow from the Lucknow airport to the Congress office has been planned.“The AICC general secretaries, Jyotiraditya Scindia ji and Priyanka ji, will interact with party workers and leaders on February 12, 13 and 14,” said K.C. Venugopal, general secretary in charge of Organisation.“Every day, the media is reporting something that the party is not aware of,” he said in a reference to earlier media reports about Ms. Vadra starting her U.P. innings with a visit to the Kumbh Mela.Inside the meeting, a source said, Ms Vadra admitted that a difficult assignment had been given to her, but assured the leadership that she would give it her best shot to win back support for the Congress in U.P. “She also said the party will continually work from the grassroots level until positive results are achieved,” said the source.In other important decisions, it was agreed that State-level alliances and the scrutiny of Lok Sabha candidates would be finalised by the end of February.Message to bureaucracyAt a convention organised by Congress’s minority cell, Mr. Gandhi said bureaucrats should work for the people of India, not any organisation, and alleged that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was trying to capture all important institutions across the country.He once again made a scathing attack on the Prime Minister, calling him a “coward.” The Congress chief challenged him to a debate on issues such as the Rafale deal, national security and the economy.“The RSS wants that the Constitution should be kept aside and the country should be run from Nagpur [RSS headquarters]. They put their people in the judicial system, Election Commission. If the CBI chief wants to start an inquiry against Mr. Modi, then the chief is replaced by their men. So their aim is to finish every institution.”The Congress chief alleged that in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where the BJP was in power for 15 years, bureaucracy had been filled with RSS loyalists.Earlier, at the convention, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev made a controversial statement that the “Modi government brought the triple talaq bill to harass Muslim men” and promised that a Congress government would undo it.\\\\n']\",\n",

       " '[\\'\\\\nCongress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday sent a letter of dissent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the government named 1983 batch IPS officer Rishi Kumar Shukla as the new chief of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Mr. Kharge, in his letter, has argued that the three member Selection Committee, that includes Prime Minister Modi and the Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, has diluted the principles laid down in Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act and the Vineet Naraian judgement.\"By including officers who do not have experience in investigating anti-corruption cases, the Committee is in violation of the DSPE Act and the Supreme Court judgements that guide the appointment of the Director, CBI,” Mr. Kharge said in his letter.He argued that officers were shortlisted \"on the basis of seniority, annual confidential reports (ACRs) and total experience in investigation and anti-corruption of 100 months or more.\" But the newly named CBI chief didn\\\\\\'t have any anti-corruption experience, claimed Mr. Kharge in his note whose contents have been accessed by The Hindu.\"All three aspects — seniority, integrity and experience in investigation of anti-corruption cases — should be given equal weightage to get the best suited officers in the shortlist,\" Mr. Kharge argued in his dissent note.\"Seniority cannot be the only criterion in an appointment to such a critical post and experience in anti-corruption cases and prior experience of having served the organization should also be considered seriously,\" he said in the note.A source familiar with the developments said though the government had shortlisted 16 officers, it was reduced to a panel of five names for consideration of the Selection Committee when it met on Friday.In the meeting, the Congress leader, representing Opposition parties, pointed out that Mr. Javed Ahmad, a 1984 Uttar Pradesh cadre officer, was best suited for the post.According to the Opposition leader, Mr. Ahmad, who had served in the CBI as a joint director earlier, had a total experience of 303 months, including 160 months of handling anti-corruption cases.This was the highest for any of the five officers under consideration. Two other officers – Rajiv Rai Bhatnagar, a 1983 UP cadre officer and Sudeep Lakhtakia of Telangana – also had some experience in handling anti-corruption assignments.\"It is important to restore the the image and integrity of the CBI as a premier institution that is fighting against corruption. Hence, prior experience of having serve the institution should be given primacy after having shortlisted candidates based on their seniority and their ACR,\" Mr. Kharge\\\\\\'s note argued.PTI adds:‘Kharge tried to manipulate CBI chief selection criteria’Mr. Kharge tried to “manipulate” the criteria for selection of CBI chief with the ulterior motive of accommodating officers of his choice in the short-list of candidates, Union Minister Jitendra Singh has claimed.He also hit out at Mr. Kharge for “giving his own version” of the panel’s deliberations to the media.“Kharge tried to manipulate the objective criteria, based on independent and impartial assessment, to select CBI Director...He wanted to include some officers of his preference in the short-list of candidates,” Mr. Singh, the Union Minister of State for Personnel, told PTI.The Minister said Justice Gogoi fully endorsed the objective criteria applied for selecting the head of the CBI.Mr. Singh, whose Ministry is the nodal department for the CBI, said the CBI Director’s selection was made in the objective criteria based on “seniority, service record and the experience in anti-corruption/investigation” areas.Mr. Singh said, “We have reasons to find fault in the manner Kharge is conducting himself in meeting after meeting violating all the norms of propriety by speaking to media and giving his own version of deliberations happening in the high-powered panel’s meet“.“Not only this, in his frequent comments to media, Kharge has gone to the extent of making unsavourily and sarcastic remarks against the prime minister and the government,” the Minister said.Mr. Singh said one should not forget how Mr. Kharge was accommodated in the three- member selection panel by the Modi government.“Established rules envisaged that the selection panel will have the Leader of Opposition (LoP) as one of the members. But as the Congress did not get enough numbers in the 2014 general elections (to be accorded the status), it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who went out of the way to include leader of Congress (the largest opposition party) in the panel... in order to add further transparency and ensure balance in the selection procedure,” he said.\\\\n\\']',\n",

Interim Budget a trailer for what will take India towards prosperity after Lok Sabha polls,” he said in a televised statement. Enumerating on the details of the Budget, Mr. Modi said more than 12 crore farmers, three crore middle class families and 30-40 crore workers employed in unorganised sector would benefit from the Budget, adding that poverty has been falling at a record rate due to the efforts of his government.Big boost“This Budget will boost the efforts of 130 crore citizens in realising the goal of a new India,” Mr. Modi said.He said the development initiatives of the NDA government have touched several lives, which have been reflected in the Budget proposals from farmer welfare to middle class, from income tax relief to infrastructure, from manufacturing to MSME, from housing to healthcare and from the increased pace of development to the New India.He congratulated the middle class for the relief in taxes and said he saluted it for its contribution towards the development of the nation.He said PM Kisan Nidhiwas a historic step for farmer welfare, which would help the farmers with less than five acres of land. He added that the animal husbandry and fisheries sectors have been taken care of in the Budget.Underlining the importance of safeguarding the interests of the unorganised sector, he said Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Man Dhan Yojanawould be of great help.

The court has posted the matter for February 11 when the statement of other witnesses will be recorded.Besides Vivek Doval, there are two other witnesses -- his friend Nikhil Kapoor and business partner Amit Sharma -- who will record their statements in support of the criminal defamation complaint.Mr. Doval in his complaint had said that the magazine and Mr. Ramesh had attempted to “deliberately malign and defame” him to “settle scores with his father.”The Caravan in its January 16 online write-up titled ‘The D Companies’ had said that Vivek Doval, “runs a hedge fund in the Cayman Islands” which is “an established tax haven” and was “registered merely 13 days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government demonetised all existing ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes, in 2016.”According to the complaint, Mr. Ramesh had held a press conference on January 17 reiterating the “baseless and unfounded facts” as narrated in the article. He had alleged that the contents of the article present “no illegality” on his part, but the entire narration has been presented in a manner, which suggests “wrongdoings” to the readers.With regard to Mr. Ramesh, the complaint said that the press conference addressed by him went “beyond the mere narration in the article” and that he was already geared and armed to launch an attack, “merely waiting for the publication of the article”, which could then provide a “smokescreen to the otherwise targeted and deliberate attack on the reputation of the complainant and his family.”It said the article has been used as a political tool to “foster in unscrupulous hands” to “seek vendetta and wreak vengeance.” It also said that the very act of setting up and launching of a hedge fund, whether in the Cayman Islands or any other place in the world, is not by itself an illegal and unlawful act.“However, the same, even without explicitly so stating, has been portrayed in a manner that leads to the very setting up and launching of the hedge fund being perceived as an unlawful act,” it said.The complaint alleged that “a web of conjectures and surmises has been devised by selective and careful nitpicking of random facts in respect of the complainant, his brother and his father — the facts being completely unrelated to one another — and presenting them in a manner that hints at deep rooted conspiracies between the family members, in carrying out laundering of black money, by rerouteing of funds into India through the Cayman Islands, in the post-demonetization era”.\\\\n']\",\n",

We have decided that if Narendra Modi can give maximum income guarantee to 15 rich people, we will give minimum income guarantee to every single citizen,” Mr. Gandhi said.\\\\n\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRahul Gandhi promises minimum income guarantee to poor if Congress returns to power \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLike MGNREGA committed right to work, like RTI committed right to information, like Food Security Bill guarantees the right to food, the Congress government is going to guarantee a minimum income to every poor Indian citizen, he told a booth-level party workers meeting in Kochi.Attacking the policies of the Modi government, he alleged that the Prime Minister had done nothing for the farmers and assured that a congress government would ensure their welfare.“We have waived off farm loans in the three states where we won elections.... [Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh]. We have committed that in 2019, we will have a government that will make up for all the crimes that Narendra Modi has done against farmers in five years,” he said.Assures passage of Women’s Reservation BillThe Congress president said the Women’s Reservation Bill would be passed on a priority if the party was voted to power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“The first thing we will do when we win the 2019 election is to pass the Women’s Reservation Bill in the Parliament,” he said.He was responding to a suggestion from a party worker on the need for more women candidates.“We want to see women in position of leadership,” he added.The bill seeking to reserve 33% of seats in Parliament and legislature has been pending for a long time in view of lack of consensus.Sabarimala issueRefraining from directly commenting on the sensitive Sabarimala temple issue, wherein the Supreme Court had permitted entry of women of all age groups into the Lord Ayyappa temple, he merely said the party respects the traditions of Kerala.“Congress party respects women of Kerala and at the same time respects the traditions of Kerala. We do not agree with the violence carried out by the BJP and CPI(M) in the State,” he said.The 69 day annual pilgrimage season in Sabarimala, which ended on January 20, had witnessed widespread protests from devotees and right wing groups.This was over the CPI(M)-led LDF government’s decision to implement the September 28 Apex Court verdict, allowing women of all ages to enter the shrine.‘Shakti’ programmeThe Congress president referred to Kerala as not just a State, but an ‘idea’.“It is a way of looking at the world that includes compassion, humility, respect. People of Kerala are helping guide the people of India,” he said.“Don’t think less of yourself. RSS has cadres, CPI(M) has cadres, but India lives in the hearts of Congress workers’, he told the gathering.Mr. Gandhi alleged that the CPI(M) and BJP work on ‘dividing’ the people of Kerala and said the real issue of jobs and protection of farmers was put on the back burner.He also flayed the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax.Mr. Gandhi told the Congress workers that the party had launched a ‘shakti’ programme in which all workers could directly talk to the leadership.“Want every single Congress worker to feel ‘Ente booth, ente abhimaan, ente party’ [My booth, my pride, my party].”\\\\n']\",\n",
       " \"['\\\\nOn the eve of the examination season, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a two hour scripted interaction with selected school and college students on how to cope with stress and pressure.The 2,000-odd students, parents and teachers present at the capital’s Talkatora Stadium on Tuesday, as well as those who asked questions via videoconference from different parts of India and the world, had been selected through an online essay contest on how they were inspired by Mr. Modi’s ‘Exam Warriors’ book or caption-writing for a picture of the Statue of Unity.In many schools and colleges across the country, viewing the Pariksha pe Charcha 2.0 event broadcast was compulsory.The University Grants Commission required colleges to upload information on students and teachers who viewed the programme — along with photo and viedographic evidence of participation — on its University Activity Monitoring Portal by 5 p.m. on Tuesday.About 11 crore students in 10.5 lakh government schools watched the programme live, apart from more than 2 crore students in CBSE-affiliated schools, according to an official statement.Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar led the crowd in a cheer borrowed from movie dialogue — “How’s the josh? High, sir” – before chants of “Modi, Modi” reverberated across the stadium.A quick sampling of student responses in the online contest revealed a plethora of Modi fans.“I read Pradhan Mantriji’s book before my 10th board exams last year. It helped enhance my concentration and confidence,” said Twinkle Sharma, a Class 11 student of Indraprastha Public School in Mavikala, a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat district. Other students at the event had written essays on how the PM’s book honed their time management skills, clarified their life goals and eased stress for them and their parents.In fact, a good chunk of the PM’s remarks at the event seemed to be addressed to the parents. “Parents should not treat their children’s report cards as their visiting cards,” said Mr. Modi, warning that expecting children to fulfil parents’ dreams would only add an unhealthy dose of extra pressure.He also encouraged them to spend time listening to their children to stave off depression and to recognise that a holistic education could not be reduced to high marks and top ranks.Most students had memorised their prepared questions, several of which were prefaced with praise for the Prime Minister. “What motivates you to be energetic and tirelessly enthusiastic in your 17-hour hectic work schedule? As students, how can we also do proper time management schedules in accomplishing our goals?” asked Narendran, from Pollachi, Tamil Nadu.Throughout the two-hour interaction, Mr. Modi peppered his responses with self-help advice and patriotic mantras about serving the nation. He delighted students with his reference to current pop culture, when a parent complained that her child was obsessed with online games. “PUBG wala hai kya?” he asked, referring to the popular online game Players Unknown Battle Grounds. “Don’t let Playstation make you forget the playing field.”PTI adds: “Only when you take it in spirit and encourage your child, a 60% holder move towards 70 or 80%. If you only criticise and scold your child for not getting 90%, you will demotivate your child to start believing that they are incapable. This will take their grades further down towards 40%.“If parents start comparing their child with achievement of others, it disappoints the child. Parents should encourage their children for every small improvement,” the Prime Minister added.‘Observe and be curious’Mr. Modi said at present, the education system has become rank-bound and rather than running behind ranks, parents and teachers should teach the students to learn from things around them.“Live freely, observe and be curious to know new things rather than focussing on achieving only ranks. These days the meaning of education has narrowed down to getting ranks in exam for many,” he said.With less than a month to go for the class 10 and class 12 examinations, Mr. Modi discussed ways to handle the exam stress in the interactive session at the Talkatora Stadium where students from across the country got a chance to participate.“Our learning cannot be reduced to exams only. Our education must equip us to face various challenges of life as well. I sincerely believe that anything that challenges us, polishes us too. If there is nothing to test us, then we become complacent. There must always be something to challenge us,” he said.‘You are your own competition’Jairpeet Singh, a student based in Tehran, asked the Prime Minister about the need to encourage schoolchildren constantly and how it makes them happy.“Compare yourself with your old records, you are your own competition, you break your records, you will never have the chance to drown in a trough of despair if you break your records yourself,” the Prime Minister replied.“Exams are important in life, but one should not be stressed by it. Ask yourselves if this is an exam of your life or is it just an exam for a particular grade like class 10 or 12. Once you know the answer to this, your pressure will reduce,” he added.The Prime Minister advised the students to aim big in life, but do not get carried away in the process of realising them.“While aiming big in life is good, but don’t get so carried away by it that your dreams remain dreams and you become too old just thinking about it. We must understand ourselves. We must be true to ourselves, question ourselves frequently to see how we stand periodically as compared to our ambitions and dreams in life.“If you see yourself far from it, then you know what to do. You must break your dreams into phases and give it a time frame to achieve. You must cross one milestone at a time. Climb from a smaller peak to a larger one,” Mr. Modi said.‘Analyse your passion’Talking about depression Mr. Modi said, “Students living in hostel can also find some senior or a person with whom they can share their feelings. Parents should try to connect their child with someone who can help their child in the time of crisis or need. A get-together once in a weekend will also help.”When a student asked how they should convince their parents that they want to follow a passion of their own choice, he said, “Analyse your passion and figure out if you have the ability and a plan to follow it. Take guidance from your teachers. Then convince your parents and assure them that you can do it.”\\\\n']\",\n",

Deve Gowda said “things like ‘Operation Kamala’ should not happen in the country.” ‘Operation Kamala’, with a reference to the BJP’s party symbol, is a name given to any move to lure members of a rival party to its side by the BJP.Refuting the allegations, Minister for Statistics and Programme Implementation Sadananda Gowda said there was already infighting between the Congress and the JD(S) in Karnataka, and that both parties were involved in “fake activities”.Mr. Gowda claimed that the two parties were making the allegations just to save the Chief Minister’s chair. “All things uttered [here]... are false and far from truth,” Mr. Sadananda Gowda said.Congress members had also trooped into the Well, displaying placards with the message ‘Operation Kamala. Death of Democracy’ written on some of them.Telegu Desam Party (TDP) members joined them in the Well as they sought to raise issues related to Andhra Pradesh.

The officer in charge of the local Hanskhali police station and one of Mr. Biswas’ bodyguards have also been suspended.Mr. Biswas was shot from behind by armed gunmen near his house in the Phoolbari area of Nadia district in south Bengal when he was attending a Saraswati puja event.According to one eyewitness, three miscreants “shot at” Mr. Biswas and a country- made revolver was recovered from the area. At the time of the incident, the MLA was surrounded by several local Trinamool activists, the eyewitness said.Two persons, Sujit Mandal and Kartik Mandal, were taken into custody while three persons have been detained for interrogation, district police officials said.However, family members of the arrested men have denied their involvement in the incident. Wife of Kartik Mandal said he was not associated with the BJP; Sujit Mandal joined the BJP only recently, his mother said.Seeks CBI probeMukul Roy, former general secretary of the Trinamool and party’s ex-MP from Nadia, also denied any links with the killing.“The incident is unfortunate. My named is dragged into it to give it political colour. Mamata Banerjee is terrified after witnessing people’s participation in Prime Minister’s recent rallies and thus trying to entangle us in such cases. Biswas was a victim of Trinamool’s internal feud,” he said.State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said, “Whenever any violence will take place, the Trinamool will blame the BJP completely suppressing the fact that they have huge internecine factional feud. They are engaged in various kinds of illegal trade like sand mining or soil mining and these killings are connected to the distribution of money.” He has demanded a CBI probe into the killing.However, several Trinamool leaders who attended Mr. Biswas’ last rites blamed the BJP. “Where is sand or soil mining in Nadia?

Why did the BJP wait for 5 years to investigate? To pull corrupt members into its own fold?” he wrote on his Twitter timeline.At a press conference, Mr. Yechury asserted that the issue could not be treated now as an infringement of Centre-State relations. The CBI’s action was based on Supreme Court’s directions.“What is objectionable is when the CBI suo motu takes action and investigates without permission of the State government; that would be a violation,” the CPI (M) leader said. “That is not the case here. So it is not an issue of Centre-State relations,” he added.Terming the court’s directive a ‘moral victory’ for the investigating agency, senior BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said it was a blow to the State government led by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The ruling showed that nobody is above the law, including the police commissioner, he added.Congress Rajya Sabha MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi who appeared on behalf of the West Bengal government hailed the order as a “great victory”.

The Sena, which is part of the Central and Maharashtra governments, has been at loggerheads with the BJP.Mr. Kishor is credited with conceptualising and implementing innovative strategies like the chai pe charcha with Narendra Modi, who was the BJP’s prime ministerial nominee at that time, that are said to have contributed to the BJP’s stupendous victory in the 2014 elections. He is currently the vice-president of the JD (U).“As part of NDA, we look forward to joining forces with you in Maharashtra to help secure victory in upcoming Lok Sabha elections &amp; beyond. @nitishkumar,” Mr. Kishor tweeted while tagging JD(U) president Nitish Kumar. Mr. Kishor re-tweeted Shiv Sena youth wing president Aditya Thackeray’s tweet welcoming him at their residence Matoshree in suburban Bandra. “Thank you for your warm hospitality Uddhav ji and @AUThackeray,” he tweeted. Earlier this afternoon, Mr. Aditya Thackeray tweeted: “Today Uddhav Thackeray ji and I had a special visitor over lunch. Some great talks @PrashantKishor ji”. The Thackeray junior also tweeted photos of Mr. Kishor.A close aide of Mr. Uddhav Thackeray said no senior BJP leader had visited the residence of the Sena chief since 2014 except BJP chief Amit Shah, and held talks about the alliance between the two parties. Sena leaders refused to divulge details of the meeting between Mr. Uddhav Thackeray and Mr. Kishor.After falling out with Mr. Modi, Mr. Kishor worked with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for the 2015 Assembly elections campaign. He was reportedly instrumental in bringing together Mr. Kumar and his arch rival RJD chief Lalu Prasad to take on the BJP during the polls.Mr. Kishor was later roped in by the Congress for the Assembly elections held in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in 2017. While the Congress returned to power in Punjab, it fared badly in Uttar Pradesh.Several Congress leaders like Randeep Surjewala had hailed Mr. Kishor for the Punjab outcome.In Maharashtra, the future of electoral alliance between the Sena and the BJP is under cloud with the the Uddhav Thackeray-led party giving mixed signals about its willingness to contest Lok Sabha polls with the BJP by its side. Both the parties contested the 2014 general elections in an alliance, but went solo in the Assembly elections held in October 2014. The Sena on January 24, 2018 announced to contest all the forthcoming elections on its own strength.

The Trinamool government does not touch a project unless there is a syndicate involved in it or they have no opting of receiving a kickback; this is an anti-development government,” Mr. Modi said.“Every child knows that there is a thing called triple T in Bengal — Trinamool Tolabaji Tax — which every job aspirant has to pay,” Mr. Modi said at a rally in Durgapur in Bardhhaman district.

He appealed to BJP workers in the State to work to increase the party’s tally from 73 in 2014 to 74 in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.“Just win us these polls in 2019, you won’t see either bua [Ms. Mayawati] or bhatija [Mr. Akhilesh Yadav] in Uttar Pradesh for 25 years,” Mr. Shah said in another meeting in Lucknow, addressing booth members of the Awadh region.‘Selfish politics’Mr. Shah said the anti-BJP alliance was not one of principles, but an alliance of “crime, corruption and casteism,” and of “selfish politics.”“Those who engaged in politics of dynasty and casteism all their life have come together to defeat nationalism and to stop the development of Uttar Pradesh,” said Mr. Shah.The BJP chief said that while the four Bs of the BJP stood for “Badhta Bharat, Banta Bharat,” the Opposition Bs only referred to “Bua, Bhatija, Bhai aur Behen,” attacking the top leadership of the SP, BSP and the Congress.He reminded party workers that despite the SP and Congress forming an alliance in 2017 Assembly polls, the BJP [and allies] had secured a thumping majority of 325 seats.In both events, Mr. Shah heaped praise on the Modi government for the “surgical strikes” conducted by the Army in 2016 and the Centre’s application filed in the Supreme Court on returning the “superfluous” land acquired around the 0.313-acre disputed land in Ayodhya.Ram templeMr. Shah asked party workers to remove all “confusion from heart” on the Ram mandir issue, assuring them that the BJP wanted the construction of a grand Ram temple to start at the disputed site in Ayodhya at the earliest.“The case must have a quick decision,” Mr. Shah said, while accusing the Congress of delaying the hearing in the apex court through its lawyers. The Congress had no right to raise the Ram Mandir issue, he added.The BJP chief said Opposition leaders were out to change the country without a “leader or policy,” and that “only a man like Narendra Modi with a 56-inch chest can take the country forward.”Pat for Yogi govt.The State government run by Yogi Adityanath was also lavished with praise by Mr. Shah, who, without referring to police encounters, said the Chief Minister had established the “rule of law” in Uttar Pradesh, and now criminals were giving themselves up in fright.The Adityanath government also distributed benefits of schemes without any discrimination and ended casteism, said Mr. Shah, stressing, “this government is not of any particular caste.”\\\\n']\",\n",

But in West Bengal, the polls will be about restoring democracy,” Shah told a rally here.Mocking the entry of Priyanka Gandhi into active politics, he said: “During the UPA rule, we had witnessed huge scams such as 2G. Now the third G has jumped on the bandwagon.... Now we have Priyanka G (Gandhi). What will be the amount of the scam? So now, they (the Congress) want to add 2G and the third G and indulge in more corruption,” Mr. Shah said.\\\\n']\",\n",

Mr. Gowda, who took the initiative of bringing together non-BJP leaders on a common platform and sending a strong signal to the BJP-led NDA eight months ago says people have to be made confident that a Congress-led front would offer a stable government for five years. However, he says it is not right to blame the Congress alone on issues related to consolidation of the Opposition. Regional parties should also understand the ground realities and make sacrifices to a certain extent. Excerpts from an interview:Prime Minister Narendra Modi has targeted the Opposition plans for an alliance as a choice between a majboot and majboor (strong and weak) government, besides describing Opposition unity as ‘comical’ and ‘opportunistic’.If the grand alliance can’t understand its problems and address them, there is no point in reacting to the criticism of Mr. Modi. People of the country want a stable government. With the polls to the Lok Sabha round the corner, leaders of the Opposition should sink their differences and provide a clear road map on how they plan to provide a stable government for five years and ensure good governance. Regional parties, which came together with an idea of fighting the threat to secular and democratic values should sit together and discuss the modalities of seat sharing with an open mind. It is better to understand that the goal will be achieved only by going with the Congress. But, the rift between the regional parties and the Congress has provided Mr. Modi an opportunity to attack the grand alliance plan. Mr. Modi is all set to destroy the secular nature of the country and all constitutional institutions.\\\\n\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpposition flexes its muscle in Kolkata rally\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat was the trigger for the differences in the Opposition ranks?The leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party, Mayawati, sought 10 seats in the recent polls to the Madhya Pradesh Assembly. The Congress could have conceded the demand. But it did not. The BSP won two seats in Madhya Pradesh and six seats in Rajasthan. This development resulted in the coming together of the Samajwadi Party and the BSP in Uttar Pradesh and the Congress deciding to contest independently. I don’t consider this as a failure, but a significant political development, which created confidence in Mr. Modi to attack Opposition unity as a failed experiment. The confidence of Mr. Modi, which got dented with the initiation of the plans for a grand alliance after the Opposition leaders came on a common platform during the swearing-in of H.D. Kumaraswamy as Karnataka Chief Minister, got reinvigorated with the differences in the Opposition.Is there still room for a course correction?Of course. But, the Congress is yet to warm to the idea of a united fight against the BJP. The Congress could have taken forward the unity of the Opposition by organising rallies with regional parties, which are eager to support it, across the country. Had the Congress done this, a formidable Opposition combine would have taken shape by this time. However, it has been eight months since the national leaders congregated for a show of strength in Bengaluru.\\\\n\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUnity and strength: on the Opposition rally\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBut, the BJP wants to know who is the Opposition’s choice for the Prime Minister’s post?Congress president Rahul Gandhi is a natural choice.

And that is why, the Congress can present the Opposition vision for the country.Will the entry of Priyanka Gandhi change the prospects of the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls?I think Priyanka Gandhi will do better than Rahul Gandhi.

The PMO refused the suggestion of an escrow account. Not only was there no sovereign guarantee from the French government but it now appears that the PMO also batted for no bank guarantees.

The Chowkidar himself opened the door to allow Anil Ambani to steal 30,000 Cr. from the IAF.”He later referred twice to the media report — first in his speech at the day-long fast by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N.

I was among very few Congress leaders who did not oppose bifurcation of the State, since the party had already taken the decision and it was in our manifesto. I had made a few suggestions on how to go about it. I don’t think these suggestions were even discussed. The manner and timing of bifurcation was not correct.So, why now?I waited till the very end. Those who are at the helm of affairs in Andhra Pradesh, they come from YSR Reddy stream. After his son formed a new party, these people continued to be there. Once Oommen Chandy came from Kerala as the general secretary in-charge of the State, I expected that he would restore the party and strengthen it in the State. I met Mr. Chandy and spoke to him on several instances but nothing happened. For all practical purposes the party does not exist in Andhra. People are questioning my timing because of the upcoming elections. But I have not decided to join this way or that. But if your voice is not heard in the party, your mails do not receive acknowledgement, your suggestions are not considered what is the point in remaining in such a party?Was it because of Congress president Rahul Gandhi did not meet you?During that time Rahul Gandhi was very busy making election tours. That is too petty a reason to leave a party that I have been in for 40 to 45 years. The basic reason for my quitting is because I did not see any intent to strengthen the party or to build it back. My problem is not with him but the people who are with him and handle the affairs of Andhra Pradesh. They led the party to total liquidation in Andhra.How do you see the prospects of the Congress in Andhra and rest of the nation?In Andhra, at least, I believe that Congress will get fewer votes than it got in 2014. As far as the rest of the nation is concerned, where there are regional parties, they will take care of the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah combine and wherever regional parties are not there, Congress will win by default. I wish the Congress well.Did you expect that party under Rahul Gandhi would change for better?When he became vice-president, I was there in Jaipur in January 2013.

Here, it is absolutely clear that the Prime Minister has stolen ₹30,000 crore of your money, bypassed a process, and given it to his friend Mr. Anil Ambani,’’ Mr. Gandhi said.“Please take a look at this…friends in the Air Force, Generals, pilots…it is written clearly here that the Prime Minister is a thief. He has stolen ₹30,000 crore from you,” said Mr. Gandhi and quickly added, “I am using strong words, I don’t like using strong words, but, I am forced to use this word because it is the truth.”Citing it as ‘an open and shut case’ of the Prime Minister’s guilt in the Rafale deal, Mr. Gandhi also accused the government of lying to the Supreme Court.“They lied to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court had this paper work, do you think the Supreme Court would have given the judgment that they gave? This was withheld from the Supreme Court, of course. So that entire judgment is also in question, that judgment is now completely in question,” he said.‘Corporate warfare’“It is absolutely corporate warfare between corporates and the Defence Ministry and Mr. Narendra Modi is the representative of Mr. Anil Ambani,” he said, countering the government’s attack that the Congress chief is part of a corporate war to scuttle the Rafale deal.He also denied the government’s charge that he was rattled because of the action against his brother-in-law Robert Vadra.“Whatever inquiry you want to do, you do it. You implement the law. Robert Vadra, P. Chidambaram — you implement the law on everyone. No problem. But you also give answers on the Rafale matter,” he told reporters with Mr. Chidambaram seated by his side.The Congress not only kept the pressure on the Modi government through the day but also responded to the government’s claim that The Hindu report didn’t reveal the then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar’s file noting of the officials ‘over-reacting.’“The note which has been released by the government actually indicts the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister’s Office much more than the original newspaper report,” former Union Minister Manish Tewari told a press conference.\\\\n']\",\n",

He also pointed to reports showing unemployment in the country at a 45-year high as reflecting the government’s failure on the jobs front.“I think it’s an insult to the Indian farmer to turn around and tell him that you are going to give him ₹17 a day; there couldn’t have been bigger insult than this,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters. “And as far as jobs are concerned, everybody knows that we are on a 45-year-high of unemployment. So, there is complete failure on these two fronts,” he added.“The surgical strike is going to happen on Mr. Modi in the next two months,” the Congress leader said, when asked if the budget proposals were a ‘surgical strike’ by the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the gegeneral elections. “There is going to be one surgical strike after the other: on Rafale, on demonetisation, on jobs and agriculture,” Mr. Gandhi asserted.“My one line comment on the Budget is that it was not a Vote on Account but an Account for Votes,” former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said.He also pointed out that the budget document was silent on jobs, education and described the income tax sops for the middle class as ‘mere’ tweaking of slabs.The former Finance Minister said the Congress party’s promise of a minimum income guarantee could not be compared with the government’s assured income support that he likened to an offer of ‘half a cup of tea’.“Please do not compare this ‘half a cup of tea scheme’, for what we have in mind is relief to every poor household so that every poor household comes up to a level of minimum income,” he said, referring to the Congress’s promise of a minimum income guarantee.Mr. Chidambaram also promised a ‘better designed tax architecture’.“We have always pleaded for a completely new direct taxes code which will completely redesign the architecture of income tax.

And the answer is that the Prime Minister of India is corrupt,” he said.The Congress has been targeting Mr. Modi on the deal alleging that the price of each aircraft was sharply hiked from around ₹526 crore, negotiated under the deal during UPA, to ₹1,600 crore and that the contract would help Mr. Anil Ambani get ₹30,000 crore benefit through offset contract.The government has denied the charges and has accused the Congress of spreading ‘falsehood’ on the issue.Mr. Gandhi questioned the removal of the CBI chief even after the Supreme Court reinstated him and alleged that the Prime Minister did it to “protect himself” and “ensure that no enquiry is carried out” against him in the Rafale deal.“Why did the ex-President of France tell the press clearly that he was told by the Indian Prime Minister to give the Rafale contract to Mr. Anil Ambani? I want to ask why was a man who has no experience in building an aircraft given a contract after it was snatched away from those people [Hindustan Aeronautical Limited], who are building the aircraft for 70 years?” Mr. Gandhi asked.The Congress president said thousands of young Indians who could have got high paid jobs in HAL have now ‘lost the opportunity’.No defence capabilities were going to be built in India due to Mr. Modi’s actions, he alleged.\\\\n']\",\n",

[Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh]. We have committed that in 2019, we will have a government that will make up for all the crimes that Narendra Modi has done against farmers in five years,” he said.Assures passage of Women’s Reservation BillThe Congress president said the Women’s Reservation Bill would be passed on a priority if the party was voted to power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“The first thing we will do when we win the 2019 election is to pass the Women’s Reservation Bill in the Parliament,” he said.He was responding to a suggestion from a party worker on the need for more women candidates.“We want to see women in position of leadership,” he added.The bill seeking to reserve 33% of seats in Parliament and legislature has been pending for a long time in view of lack of consensus.Sabarimala issueRefraining from directly commenting on the sensitive Sabarimala temple issue, wherein the Supreme Court had permitted entry of women of all age groups into the Lord Ayyappa temple, he merely said the party respects the traditions of Kerala.“Congress party respects women of Kerala and at the same time respects the traditions of Kerala. We do not agree with the violence carried out by the BJP and CPI(M) in the State,” he said.The 69 day annual pilgrimage season in Sabarimala, which ended on January 20, had witnessed widespread protests from devotees and right wing groups.This was over the CPI(M)-led LDF government’s decision to implement the September 28 Apex Court verdict, allowing women of all ages to enter the shrine.‘Shakti’ programmeThe Congress president referred to Kerala as not just a State, but an ‘idea’.“It is a way of looking at the world that includes compassion, humility, respect. People of Kerala are helping guide the people of India,” he said.“Don’t think less of yourself. RSS has cadres, CPI(M) has cadres, but India lives in the hearts of Congress workers’, he told the gathering.Mr. Gandhi alleged that the CPI(M) and BJP work on ‘dividing’ the people of Kerala and said the real issue of jobs and protection of farmers was put on the back burner.He also flayed the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax.Mr. Gandhi told the Congress workers that the party had launched a ‘shakti’ programme in which all workers could directly talk to the leadership.“Want every single Congress worker to feel ‘Ente booth, ente abhimaan, ente party’ [My booth, my pride, my party].”\\\\n']\",\n",

The PMO refused the suggestion of an escrow account. Not only was there no sovereign guarantee from the French government but it now appears that the PMO also batted for no bank guarantees.

Chowkidar is important for the BJP/RSS, not his honesty?” She then said, “People of the country have to decide what to do with the “Chowkidar and his so-called honesty.”In a tweet tagging The Hindu’s report, Mr. Gandhi said, “NoMo anti-corruption clause. The Chowkidar himself opened the door to allow Anil Ambani to steal 30,000 Cr. from the IAF.”He later referred twice to the media report — first in his speech at the day-long fast by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu which he attended as a gesture of solidarity with the TDP, and later during the Congress’ road show with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Lucknow.“The Prime Minister became Prime Minister by saying he is going to fight corruption. Have you read The Hindu newspaper today, did you read The Hindu newspaper yesterday?... The Prime Minister has stolen from the people of Andhra Pradesh and he has given that money to Mr. Anil Ambani,” the Congress chief said.Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in a series of tweets said the Rafale deal was “unravelling faster than the government thought”.Pointing to the series reports in The Hindu, he said, “Now it is revealed that crucial changes were made to the clauses in the standard Defence Procurement Procedure. No sovereign guarantee, no bank guarantee, no escrow account, yet a huge amount was paid as advance.” No penalty clause for undue influence, no clause against agency commission, no clause for access to suppliers accounts and Dassault goes laughing all the way to the bank.”The Communist Party of India reiterated its demand for a probe by Joint Parliamentary panel in the light of the latest revelations.“The Hindu story has brought the Rafale deal in perspective of how PMO took upon itself not only to negotiate the deal but also to facilitate it by removing critical clauses. The government stands thoroughly exposed. The entire truth of this deal can be brought out only if it is probed by a joint Parliamentary Committee,” CPI leader D.

Officials said the Investigating Officer (IO) of the case required Mr. Vadra to answer more questions in connection with the case and hence was asked to depose on Saturday, after his two sessions of questioning on February 6 and 7.While Mr. Vadra was questioned for the first time for about five-and-a-half hours, he was grilled the second time for about 9 hours. It is understood that the last time Mr. Vadra was “confronted with” documents that the agency had obtained or seized as part of its probe in the case, including those linked to absconding defence dealer Sanjay Bhandari. Mr. Vadra has also shared documents with the investigating officer of the case and has assured some more will be provided as and when he gets them, official sources had said. The ED case against Mr. Vadra relates to allegations of money laundering in the purchase of a London-based property located at 12, Bryanston Square worth £1.9 million, which is allegedly owned by him. The agency has told a Delhi court that it has received information about various new properties in London which belong to Vadra. These include two houses, one worth £5 million and the other valued at £4 million, six other flats and more properties. Mr. Vadra has denied the allegations of possessing illegal foreign assets and termed them a political witch hunt against him. He said he was being “hounded and harassed” to subserve political ends.

Taking questions from the audience, the panellists answered a range of questions: from Congress’ doublespeak on the Sabarimala verdict to the threat of ‘dynasts’ in a democracy.When theatre personality Amir Raja Hussain, present in the audience, pointed out that the Congress was now scared even to speak up for minorities, Mr. Khurshid said the party had combined strategy with ideology.“We are dealing with a slippery opponent who turns everything we say on its head. Why should the Congress allow the BJP to claim monopoly over Hinduism?” Mr. Khurshid said.When another question was asked about Congress’ position on Sabarimala and how the party was not ‘respecting’ the Supreme Court verdict to allow women of menstruating age to enter the shrine, Mr. Chidamabaram said though he personally favoured the judgement, there were lakhs of people in Kerala who felt it interfered with customs.Another member from the audience asked whether or not political parties having dynasts as leaders was a threat to democracy of India. Mr Chidambaram pointed out that the Gandhi-Nehru family didn’t have anyone in the government for the past 30 years but maintained that a member of the family was ‘most acceptable to the party workers’.Ending the discussion on what he thinks is the idea of India, Mr Chidambaram said, “everyone knows what the idea of India is.

They put their people in the judicial system, Election Commission. If the CBI chief wants to start an inquiry against Mr. Modi, then the chief is replaced by their men.

The group does not support universal basic income or cash transfer schemes.Urgent reformsThe group has invited political parties to discuss the document on Friday. The Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal, and Nationalist Congress Party have so far agreed to participate.“We see the forthcoming Lok Sabha election as an opportunity to retrieve and, indeed, reclaim from manipulation and subversion, our legacy of the Republic.

Shah said that the group’s suggestions were aimed at protecting constitutional safeguards, and starting the conversation on the practical policies needed to fulfil the promise of India’s foundational document.“In election season, public discourse is often reduced to mudslinging and seat share calculations,” said Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav. “At a time when the very foundation of our democracy are threatened, we want a discussion of actual issues and policies,” he said.

The section on employment, food, and social security, for example, would involve expenditure amounting to about 5% of GDP. Dr. Patnaik estimated that implementing all the proposals in the document might cost 10% of GDP.

Two other officers – Rajiv Rai Bhatnagar, a 1983 UP cadre officer and Sudeep Lakhtakia of Telangana – also had some experience in handling anti-corruption assignments.\"It is important to restore the the image and integrity of the CBI as a premier institution that is fighting against corruption.

But as the Congress did not get enough numbers in the 2014 general elections (to be accorded the status), it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who went out of the way to include leader of Congress (the largest opposition party) in the panel... in order to add further transparency and ensure balance in the selection procedure,” he said.\\\\n\\']',\n",

In 2017, a few months before the Gujarat Assembly election, Mr. Vaghela quit the Congress — along with several legislators, including his son Mahendrasinh Vaghela — staging a rebellion against Congress veteran Ahmed Patel during the Rajya Sabha election. However, he was isolated in the State politics after the election, with neither the BJP nor the Congress inclined to take him back. Mahendrasinh Vaghela joined the BJP after the Assembly election, but walked out. He is not affiliated to any party now. \\\\n']\",\n",
       " \"['\\\\nThe departure of one of Congress’ four MPs, Mausam Benazir Noor, elected from Malda-North in central Bengal, has caused major ripples in the Congress. Many party workers and leaders now ask if the party will be able to keep the rest of the flock – three MPs and two dozen MLAs – together before the Lok Sabha polls given that the Trinamool Congress has already poached about one-and-a-half dozen of Congress MLAs since 2016. Ms. Noor, the niece of legendary Congress leader A.B.A. Ghani Khan Choudhury, joined TMC on Monday and said that she “trusts Mamata Banerjee in her fight against communalism.” Her departure has dented the average Congress worker’s confidence.“Congress’ national leaders and possible coalition partners shared the stage with Mamata Banerjee about a week back. We never thought she would poach from the Congress after that January 19 rally but she did. It indicates how ruthless she is,” said one of Congress MLAs from Malda.MLAs from two Assembly segments under Malda-North Lok Sabha constituency joined the TMC over the last few months. One of them, Samar Mukherjee, was with the Congress; the other, Dipali Biswas, belonged to the CPI-M. “It had shaken the confidence of Noor,” said the MLA. Ms Noor was also the Malda district president of the Congress.One of the other factors for Ms Noor’s leaving the party is the BJP’s growth in parts of her constituency. The BJP had won six of Malda district’s 38 Zilla Parishad seats in the three-tier panchayat poll last year despite large scale violence. While the TMC’s seats went up from six (in 2013) to 30 (2018), the BJPs’ jumped from naught to six. Ms. Noor read the writing on the wall and left the party that was never defeated in Malda since 1980. “Huge turnout in Amit Shah’s meeting in her constituency earlier the month also disturbed her,” the MLA, known for his proximity to Ms Noor, said. Congress president Somendra Nath Mitra said that Ms Noor’s desertion will not affect the Congress’ poll prospects in anyway, indicating that the nephew of Ghani Khan Choudhury, Isha Khan Choudhury will be their candidate in Malda-North. If so, then Malda North will witness a fight between two cousins – Mausam Noor from TMC and Isha Khan from Congress – and the seat is likely to stay with the family.\\\\n']\",\n",
       " \"['\\\\nFormer Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda appears to be upset with the Congress. Mr. Gowda, who took the initiative of bringing together non-BJP leaders on a common platform and sending a strong signal to the BJP-led NDA eight months ago says people have to be made confident that a Congress-led front would offer a stable government for five years. However, he says it is not right to blame the Congress alone on issues related to consolidation of the Opposition. Regional parties should also understand the ground realities and make sacrifices to a certain extent. Excerpts from an interview:Prime Minister Narendra Modi has targeted the Opposition plans for an alliance as a choice between a majboot and majboor (strong and weak) government, besides describing Opposition unity as ‘comical’ and ‘opportunistic’.If the grand alliance can’t understand its problems and address them, there is no point in reacting to the criticism of Mr. Modi. People of the country want a stable government. With the polls to the Lok Sabha round the corner, leaders of the Opposition should sink their differences and provide a clear road map on how they plan to provide a stable government for five years and ensure good governance. Regional parties, which came together with an idea of fighting the threat to secular and democratic values should sit together and discuss the modalities of seat sharing with an open mind. It is better to understand that the goal will be achieved only by going with the Congress. But, the rift between the regional parties and the Congress has provided Mr. Modi an opportunity to attack the grand alliance plan. Mr. Modi is all set to destroy the secular nature of the country and all constitutional institutions.\\\\n\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpposition flexes its muscle in Kolkata rally\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat was the trigger for the differences in the Opposition ranks?The leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party, Mayawati, sought 10 seats in the recent polls to the Madhya Pradesh Assembly. The Congress could have conceded the demand. But it did not. The BSP won two seats in Madhya Pradesh and six seats in Rajasthan. This development resulted in the coming together of the Samajwadi Party and the BSP in Uttar Pradesh and the Congress deciding to contest independently. I don’t consider this as a failure, but a significant political development, which created confidence in Mr. Modi to attack Opposition unity as a failed experiment. The confidence of Mr. Modi, which got dented with the initiation of the plans for a grand alliance after the Opposition leaders came on a common platform during the swearing-in of H.D. Kumaraswamy as Karnataka Chief Minister, got reinvigorated with the differences in the Opposition.Is there still room for a course correction?Of course. But, the Congress is yet to warm to the idea of a united fight against the BJP. The Congress could have taken forward the unity of the Opposition by organising rallies with regional parties, which are eager to support it, across the country. Had the Congress done this, a formidable Opposition combine would have taken shape by this time. However, it has been eight months since the national leaders congregated for a show of strength in Bengaluru.\\\\n\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUnity and strength: on the Opposition rally\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBut, the BJP wants to know who is the Opposition’s choice for the Prime Minister’s post?Congress president Rahul Gandhi is a natural choice. None of us are competing for the coveted post. And that is why, the Congress can present the Opposition vision for the country.Will the entry of Priyanka Gandhi change the prospects of the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls?I think Priyanka Gandhi will do better than Rahul Gandhi. For the general public, her appearance has certain qualities of her grandmother [Indira Gandhi] and the Congress is sure to benefit. If her entry helps the Congress, I will be the happiest person.\\\\n']\"]"
