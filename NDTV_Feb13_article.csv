It does not include the controversial and key point of pricing, as the Defence Ministry maintained that these details could not be revealed. The parts in the report referring to cost are redacted, which may provoke fresh opposition attacks.The Congress and other opposition parties have dismissed the report as biased because auditor Rajiv Mehrishi was Finance Secretary when the deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets was inked in 2016. The Congress alleges that Mr Mehrishi was ""complicit in the irregularities"" in the Rafale deal and alleged that ""the bungling was happening at the highest level with his direct or indirect complicity and consent"".The cost of the basic aircraft is the same in both cases.But the CAG report says compared to the 126-aircraft deal negotiated by the Congress-led government, India managed to save 17.08 per cent money for the India Specific Enhancements in the new contract. India had wanted 13 specific changes to the Rafale jet to make it more suited to the country\'s defence parameters. The CAG report suggests that the cost of these upgrades is far cheaper now.Aspects of the deal that are more expensive include engineering support package and performance-based logistics.""The lies of the Mahajhootbandhan stand exposed by the CAG report,"" tweeted union minister Arun Jaitley.

""She is a natural in politics and I remember that day when in a joint press conference they announced Sheila Dikshit as the chief ministerial face.

The UK university-educated wife of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav\'s half-brother Prateek has been seen to be ranged against her brother-in-law.She supported Akhilesh Yadav\'s uncle Shivpal Yadav who, after a major falling out with the former UP chief minister, quit the Samajwadi Party. However, she ruled out joining Shivpal Yadav\'s new outfit, the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party. ""We will give chachaji all the support that he needs. However, in the 2019 elections, my job is to look after Netaji\'s (Mulayam Singh Yadav\'s) Mainpuri constituency and help him win.""In the run-up to the UP election two years ago, Aparna Yadav rattled her party with her praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s style. After the BJP\'s Yogi Adityanath took over as Chief Minister, she met with the saffron-robed monk-politician and greeted him with flowers. Heading into the national election due by May, she has expressed support for the building of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, which has been at the forefront of BJP\'s poll narrative in recent months. This led many to ask if she was keen on joining the BJP. ""Let\'s see what happens,\'\' she told NDTV. Asked about contesting the election as a Samajwadi candidate, she said- ""I have spoken to Bhaiyya (Akhilesh) and if they give me a good seat, I would like to fight for that.""Aparna Yadav claims that the Samajwadi party\'s grand alliance with Mayawati\'s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is facing some major challenges. ""Mayawati ji and Bhaiyya have told the workers but in most places they are not working together.

""If they had been so serious, they could have announced them in the last Budget itself. Now, announcement of these programmes is only meant for elections. It shows it is their election manifesto and not the Budget,"" the party\'s M Thambidurai had said.The BJP, looking to gain ground in the 39-seat state, has for over a year been pursuing the AIADMK, which is seen to be greatly weakened and riven by feuding after the death of its charismatic chief J Jayalalithaa in 2016. Its rival DMK has already announced that it will partner with the Congress.A series of income tax and CBI raids on the state Health Minister, Chief Secretary and the police chief meant that the AIADMK virtually surrendered itself to the BJP.In the past few months, the AIADMK was seen to be changing its stand on any alliance with the BJP, with Mr Thambidurai saying, ""The BJP had not done anything for Tamil Nadu. We will align only with a party that is good for the state"".In the 2014 national election, the AIADMK won 37 seats in the state. The BJP, snubbed by Jayalalithaa, formed an alliance with parties like MDMK, PMK and DMDK but ended up with just two seats.This time, the AIADMK is split in two, with a rebel faction supporting Jayalalithaa\'s long-time aide VK Sasikala, who made a failed bid to take over the party and chief ministership after her death, before being jailed for corruption. Sasikala\'s nephew TTV Dhinakaran has launched AMMK and even won Jayalalithaa\'s RK Nagar constituency in a by-election.But then again, last week, the AIADMK hinted that a tie-up with the BJP was definitely brewing.

I would term it as a \'Chowkidar Auditor General Report\'. It is Narendra Modi\'s report, written for the chowkidar, on behalf of the chowkidar, for the chowkidar, by the chowkidar,"" the Congress chief told reporters this morning.The Congress has been demanding that the pricing details of the fighter jets be made public, but the government continues to say ""it can\'t"" citing a secrecy clause.Sources say the auditor was ""explicitly told by the Defence Ministry that pricing details can\'t be shared because of national security"". There was a ""lot of government pressure,"" sources told NDTV. The auditor agreed to keep pricing out of his report and carry out an audit on percentage terms.The fact that Comptroller and Auditor General Rajiv Mehrishi was the Finance Secretary when the Rafale deal was inked had also provoked Congress allegations of conflict of interest. The party accused the CAG of being ""complicit in the irregularities"" in the Rafale deal and alleged that ""the bungling was happening at the highest level with his direct or indirect complicity and consent"".Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal alleged that Mr Mehrishi would definitely try to save the BJP-led NDA government in a bid to save himself. How can the CAG investigate and act against himself, the Congress leader wondered.Mr Gandhi has also alleged that PM Modi ""acted as Anil Ambani\'s middleman"" and cited an email that he said revealed the industrialist had visited Paris and met with the French defence minister 10 days before the PM went there and announced purchase of 36 jets. The Congress president alleged that Anil Ambani was aware of the deal when even ""the Defence Minister and the Foreign Secretary didn\'t know"".""PM has compromised national security, he has done what spies do,"" Rahul Gandhi said.Anil Ambani\'s Reliance Defence said in a statement that ""facts are being deliberately twisted and reality being ignored"" and that the visit had nothing to do with Rafale.Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, in a stinging rebuttal, said: ""How Rahul Gandhi got the email of a private company is in a cloud.Regardless of the shameful manner in which Rahul Gandhi is acting as a lobbyist for companies, the country will not bend. The country needs fighter planes and good defence equipment.""The Congress alleges that the government went for an overpriced deal for Rafale jets to benefit Anil Ambani, whose Reliance Defence is one of the offset partners for Rafale maker Dassault. Both Dassault and Anil Ambani have denied the Congress allegations.The Supreme Court in December refused to investigate the deal and rejected petitions that alleged corruption, including the choice of Anil Ambani\'s firm as domestic partner.

Chandrababu Naidu, who were earlier with the BJP-led NDA, and many others who later parted company and were now the strongest critics of the ruling dispensation.""Even Raj Thackeray is now speaking a different language and is highly critical of Prime Minister Modi,"" Mr Pawar said.On his part, Raj Thackeray has made serious attempts to dilute his ""anti-north Indian"" image and on December 2 last year attended a massive gathering of the Uttar Bhartiya Mahapanchayat Sangh.6 COMMENTSHe also took the opportunity of his son\'s wedding last month to invite the leaders of all major political parties including the Congress-NCP besides union ministers and Shiv Sena leaders.']"

It does not include the controversial and key point of pricing, as the Defence Ministry maintained that these details could not be revealed. The parts in the report referring to cost are redacted, which may provoke fresh opposition attacks.The Congress and other opposition parties have dismissed the report as biased because auditor Rajiv Mehrishi was Finance Secretary when the deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets was inked in 2016. The Congress alleges that Mr Mehrishi was ""complicit in the irregularities"" in the Rafale deal and alleged that ""the bungling was happening at the highest level with his direct or indirect complicity and consent"".The cost of the basic aircraft is the same in both cases.But the CAG report says compared to the 126-aircraft deal negotiated by the Congress-led government, India managed to save 17.08 per cent money for the India Specific Enhancements in the new contract. India had wanted 13 specific changes to the Rafale jet to make it more suited to the country\'s defence parameters. The CAG report suggests that the cost of these upgrades is far cheaper now.Aspects of the deal that are more expensive include engineering support package and performance-based logistics.""The lies of the Mahajhootbandhan stand exposed by the CAG report,"" tweeted union minister Arun Jaitley. ""It cannot be that the Supreme Court is wrong, the CAG is wrong and only the dynast is right,"" he added, taking a swipe at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who has been pummeling the government with allegations of corruption in the deal to benefit industrialist Anil Ambani.According to the CAG report, a Defence Ministry team in March 2015 recommended the scrapping of the previous 126-jet Rafale deal saying that Dassault Aviation was not the lowest bidder and the other player, European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, was not fully compliant with the tender requirements.The auditor also noted that the Indian Air Force did not define the Air Staff Qualitative Requirements or ASQRs properly, so none of the vendors could fully meet the parameters.161 COMMENTSThe CAG report details have emerged as a report in The Hindu newspaper on Wednesday said at least three senior Defence Ministry officials among the seven-member Indian Negotiating Team were of the view that the final price offered by the French Government cannot be considered as \'better terms\' compared to the deal under the UPA.']"

Its rival DMK has already announced that it will partner with the Congress.A series of income tax and CBI raids on the state Health Minister, Chief Secretary and the police chief meant that the AIADMK virtually surrendered itself to the BJP.In the past few months, the AIADMK was seen to be changing its stand on any alliance with the BJP, with Mr Thambidurai saying, ""The BJP had not done anything for Tamil Nadu. We will align only with a party that is good for the state"".In the 2014 national election, the AIADMK won 37 seats in the state. The BJP, snubbed by Jayalalithaa, formed an alliance with parties like MDMK, PMK and DMDK but ended up with just two seats.This time, the AIADMK is split in two, with a rebel faction supporting Jayalalithaa\'s long-time aide VK Sasikala, who made a failed bid to take over the party and chief ministership after her death, before being jailed for corruption. Sasikala\'s nephew TTV Dhinakaran has launched AMMK and even won Jayalalithaa\'s RK Nagar constituency in a by-election.But then again, last week, the AIADMK hinted that a tie-up with the BJP was definitely brewing.

The Congress president alleged that Anil Ambani was aware of the deal when even ""the Defence Minister and the Foreign Secretary didn\'t know"".""PM has compromised national security, he has done what spies do,"" Rahul Gandhi said in a press conference, citing an email of an official of Airbus; several employees of the plane-maker were reportedly in the meeting between Anil Ambani and French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. The email by Airbus official Nicolas Chamussy, dated March 28, 2015 and marked to three recipients with the subject line ""Ambani"", described the meeting as ""confidential and planned as you can imagine with very short notice"".Holding up a copy of the email, Rahul Gandhi said: ""Anil Ambani, who met the French Defence Minister, mentioned an MoU he is looking forward to sign after the Indian prime minister\'s visit to France. Mr Ambani says he is first looking to make commercial helicopters. This is a breach of the Official Secrets Act. The PM is the only other person who knows about this. In fact, Anil Ambani opened his company after this meeting. The PM is acting as Anil Ambani\'s middleman, it is in black-and-white for anyone who reads the email.""Anil Ambani\'s Reliance Defence said in a statement that ""facts are being deliberately twisted and reality being ignored"" and that the visit had nothing to do with Rafale. A spokesperson says the industrialist visited France to discuss a deal for more than 100 Naval Utility Helicopters for which the government had sought information from international helicopter manufacturers in 2015.""The purported email being referred by the Congress party is regarding the discussion between Airbus and Reliance Defence regarding Civil and Defence Helicopter Programs under \'Make in India\'. Discussion on proposed MoU was clearly with reference to cooperation between Airbus Helicopter and Reliance. It had NO connection whatsoever with Government to Government Agreement between France and India for 36 Rafale aircraft,"" said a Reliance Defence spokesperson.Airbus refused to confirm the Reliance Defence statement, telling NDTV: ""This has no link with Airbus; we do not comment.""The Airbus email cited by the Congress said Anil Ambani ""told them he intends to work with Airbus Helicopters on commercial helos and then on defence."" He is also said to have ""mentioned a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in preparation and the intention to sign during the PM visit"".According to Reliance Defence, Airbus had told Anil Ambani that there were ""other potential partners"" and the deal fell through. It said Airbus decided to continue working with the Mahindra Group.Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, in a stinging rebuttal, said: ""How Rahul Gandhi got the email of a private company is in a cloud. Regardless of the shameful manner in which Rahul Gandhi is acting as a lobbyist for companies, the country will not bend. The country needs fighter planes and good defence equipment.""The minister also hit out at the Congress president for calling PM Modi a traitor. ""During your father and grandmother\'s time there was corruption. But we never called them traitors. Today you have put muck on your face by making this false allegation.""The Congress alleges that the government went for an overpriced deal for Rafale jets to benefit Anil Ambani, whose Reliance Defence is one of the offset partners for Rafale maker Dassault. Both Dassault and Anil Ambani have denied the Congress allegations.The Supreme Court in December refused to investigate the deal worth an alleged 8.7 billion dollars and rejected petitions that alleged corruption, including the choice of Anil Ambani\'s firm as domestic partner. But the opposition says the government concealed vital information.146 COMMENTSDisclaimer: NDTV has been sued for 10,000 crores by Anil Ambani\'s Reliance Group for its coverage of the Rafale deal ']"

BJP president Amit Shah will seal the alliance soon, say sources, adding that the deal may be done by the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi travels to Kanyakumari to address a rally on February 19.Last month, AIADMK spokesperson C Ponnaiyan had told NDTV that the cadre ""does not want any alliance with the BJP"" because they felt PM Modi\'s party didn\'t do much for the state, especially on the Cauvery dispute with Karnataka.To explain its change of heart, the southern party refers to the ""pro-poor"" announcements in the centre\'s interim budget that it had first criticised. ""If they had been so serious, they could have announced them in the last Budget itself. Now, announcement of these programmes is only meant for elections. It shows it is their election manifesto and not the Budget,"" the party\'s M Thambidurai had said.The BJP, looking to gain ground in the 39-seat state, has for over a year been pursuing the AIADMK, which is seen to be greatly weakened and riven by feuding after the death of its charismatic chief J Jayalalithaa in 2016. Its rival DMK has already announced that it will partner with the Congress.A series of income tax and CBI raids on the state Health Minister, Chief Secretary and the police chief meant that the AIADMK virtually surrendered itself to the BJP.In the past few months, the AIADMK was seen to be changing its stand on any alliance with the BJP, with Mr Thambidurai saying, ""The BJP had not done anything for Tamil Nadu. We will align only with a party that is good for the state"".In the 2014 national election, the AIADMK won 37 seats in the state. The BJP, snubbed by Jayalalithaa, formed an alliance with parties like MDMK, PMK and DMDK but ended up with just two seats.This time, the AIADMK is split in two, with a rebel faction supporting Jayalalithaa\'s long-time aide VK Sasikala, who made a failed bid to take over the party and chief ministership after her death, before being jailed for corruption. Sasikala\'s nephew TTV Dhinakaran has launched AMMK and even won Jayalalithaa\'s RK Nagar constituency in a by-election.But then again, last week, the AIADMK hinted that a tie-up with the BJP was definitely brewing. As Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam spoke about talks with regional, national and friendly parties, another AIADMK leader, D Jayakumar, said: ""Anything can happen in politics... he (Panneerselvam) gave a veiled indication... only you have to understand.""14 COMMENTSThe AIADMK has reportedly deputed its ministers to hold talks with BJP leaders including Amit Shah and union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Ravi Shankar Prasad.

Later in the day, however, Mamata Banerjee declared at an opposition meet that she would fight alongside the Congress and the Left, her enemies in Bengal, in order to defeat the BJP in the national election.Adhir Chowdhary had piped up during a discussion on a Bill to crack down on unregulated schemes and chit funds, and said Mamata Banerjee was complicit in the Saradha chit fund scam. He said lakhs of people were looted and their money should be returned. His remarks were followed by chest-thumping by delighted BJP members.Several members of Bengal\'s ruling party have been charged or arrested in the Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund cases involving the swindle of crores taken from small investors.During the campaign for the 2016 West Bengal polls, the Congress and Rahul Gandhi had repeatedly accused Mamata Banerjee of corruption linked to the chit fund cases.That situation has vastly changed ahead of the national election due by May, as opposition parties project unity against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.The Congress sent its leaders to Mamata Banerjee\'s opposition unity rally in Kolkata last month.

Her relation with the state leaders of the Congress -- the party she broke away from in 1997 -- is still acrimonious.This morning, her party faced attack from senior state Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury over the Saradha Ponzi scheme, over which several of her party leaders had been arrested.

Chandrababu Naidu, who were earlier with the BJP-led NDA, and many others who later parted company and were now the strongest critics of the ruling dispensation.""Even Raj Thackeray is now speaking a different language and is highly critical of Prime Minister Modi,"" Mr Pawar said.On his part, Raj Thackeray has made serious attempts to dilute his ""anti-north Indian"" image and on December 2 last year attended a massive gathering of the Uttar Bhartiya Mahapanchayat Sangh.6 COMMENTSHe also took the opportunity of his son\'s wedding last month to invite the leaders of all major political parties including the Congress-NCP besides union ministers and Shiv Sena leaders.']"

When the negotiations started the Ministry of Finance were part of it,"" Congress leader Kapil Sibal said on Monday.Mr Jaitley described the allegation as among the falsehoods ""manufactured on a daily basis"".""How many lies are necessary to be peddled to save a sinking dynasty? The contagion effect of falsehood is fairly large. It appears to have spread to other colleagues in the \'Mahajhootbandhan\'. In relation to the Rafale deal where thousands of crores of public money has been saved, a new falsehood is manufactured on a daily basis. The latest is in relation to the present CAG and his participation in the decision making process of Rafale,"" he added.The BJP says that Mr Gandhi and his family run a dynasty of sorts in the Congress, alluding to a number of Congress presidents coming from the Nehru-Gandhi family.""The grand old party of Indian politics has sadly become a captive of a dynasty. Many of its senior leaders lack the courage and moral authority to advise the dynasts to change course. This trend started in early 1970s; climaxed during the Emergency and has continued eversince,"" Mr Jaitley said.Mr Gandhi, who has been alleging irregularities in the Rafale deal, intensified his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after The Hindu published a 2015 internal note in which the Defence Ministry expressed its strong reservations to ""parallel negotiations"" conducted by the Prime Minister\'s Office with France on the deal.Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rejected the report as ""selective"" and ""slanderous"". ""They are flogging a dead horse. Periodical enquiries by the PMO cannot be construed as interference,"" she had said.Rahul Gandhi said today that PM Modi was ""acting as Anil Ambani\'s middleman."" He was citing an email that he said revealed the industrialist had visited Paris and met with the French Defence Minister, 10 days before the PM went there and announced the 36-jet deal with France.In a strong retort, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Mr Gandhi was acting as a ""lobbyist for companies"".""How Rahul Gandhi got the email of a private company is in a cloud.

"['Bengaluru:Cracking the whip, the Congress on Monday sought disqualification of four rebel lawmakers under the Anti-Defection law after they repeatedly remained defiant, skipping the assembly session and legislature party meetings.The Congress petitioned the assembly speaker Ramesh Kumar, seeking action against lawmakers Ramesh Jarkiholi, Umesh Jadhav, Mahesh Kumathali and B Nagendra weeks after giving them warnings to mend their ways and fall in line.Congress Legislature Party leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah met the Speaker and gave him a letter along with supporting documents to disqualify the four lawmakers.Siddaramaiah, who also heads the JDS-Congress coordination committee, was accompanied by deputy chief minister Dr G Parameshwara and Congress state president Dinesh Gundu Rao.Later, Ms Rao tweeted, ""@siddaramaiah and myself have petitioned the Hon\'\'ble Speaker, to disqualify 4 of our MLAs under the rules of the anti-defection law. Despite repeated notices &amp; issuing of whips they have been found to be in violation by their continued absence.""The four lawmakers skipped the CLP meeting on January 18, which was meant to be a show of strength in the backdrop of BJP\'s alleged bid to topple the coalition government, and another CLP meet Friday last despite a whip.They were also among those absent from the assembly since the budget session began Wednesday last.Jarkiholi was upset after he was dropped in the ministry rejig on December 22.The errant MLAs were earlier given notices, seeking an explanation for their conduct.Another Congress MLA JN Ganesh, who was reportedly onthe BJP\'s radar for desertion, is absconding ever since he allegedly assaulted fellow lawmaker Anand Singh during a brawl at a resort recently.Two independent MLAs have already announced withdrawal of their support to the coalition government and backed BJP.A possible disqualification of the four MLAs might deepen the crisis for the ruling coalition as in that event, it would be hanging by the thread with its strength just above the half way mark of 113 by one seat. COMMENTWith the two Independent MLAs withdrawing support, the ruling coalition now enjoys the backing of 118 MLAs in the 224-member house, where the BJP\'s strength is 104.']"
